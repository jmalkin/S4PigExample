12000001	12000000	"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."	1242799205000
12000002	12000000	"Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure."	1242799220000
12000003	12000000	"We are met on a great battlefield of that war."	1242799232000
12000004	12000000	"We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live."	1242799237000
12000005	12000000	"It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this."	1242799250000
12000006	12000000	"But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground."	1242799255500
12000007	12000000	"The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract."	1242799263500
12000008	12000000	"The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."	1242799274000
12000009	12000000	"It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced."	1242799284500
12000010	12000000	"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."	1242799297500
14000001	14000000	"President Hoover, Mr."	1242799505000
14000002	14000000	"Chief Justice, my friends:  This is a day of national consecration."	1242799506500
14000003	14000000	"And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency, I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels."	1242799512500
14000004	14000000	"This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly."	1242799531000
14000005	14000000	"Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today."	1242799538500
14000006	14000000	"This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper."	1242799544500
14000007	14000000	"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."	1242799551500
14000008	14000000	"In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory."	1242799569000
14000009	14000000	"And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days."	1242799584500
14000010	14000000	"In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties."	1242799593000
14000011	14000000	"They concern, thank God, only material things."	1242799600500
14000012	14000000	"Values have shrunk to fantastic levels	 taxes have risen	 our ability to pay has fallen	 government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income	 the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade	 the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side	 farmers find no markets for their produce	 and the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone."	1242799604000
14000013	14000000	"More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return."	1242799637000
14000014	14000000	"Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment."	1242799648000
14000015	14000000	"And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance."	1242799654000
14000016	14000000	"We are stricken by no plague of locusts."	1242799659000
14000017	14000000	"Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for."	1242799663000
14000018	14000000	"Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it."	1242799674500
14000019	14000000	"Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply."	1242799680000
14000020	14000000	"Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated."	1242799689500
14000021	14000000	"Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men."	1242799704000
14000022	14000000	"True, they have tried."	1242799715000
14000023	14000000	"But their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition."	1242799717000
14000024	14000000	"Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money."	1242799723500
14000025	14000000	"Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence."	1242799730500
14000026	14000000	"They only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers."	1242799744000
14000027	14000000	"They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish."	1242799749000
14000028	14000000	"Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization."	1242799755500
14000029	14000000	"We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths."	1242799763500
14000030	14000000	"The measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit."	1242799768500
14000031	14000000	"Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money	 it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort."	1242799779000
14000032	14000000	"The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits."	1242799790000
14000033	14000000	"These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves, to our fellow men."	1242799799500
16000001	16000000	"Mr."	1242799805000
16000002	16000000	"Vice President, Mr."	1242799805500
16000003	16000000	"Speaker, Members of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."	1242799807000
14000034	14000000	"Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit	 and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing."	1242799817000
16000004	16000000	"The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific."	1242799829000
16000005	16000000	"Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message."	1242799846000
14000035	14000000	"Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, and on unselfish performance	 without them it cannot live."	1242799854500
16000006	16000000	"And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack."	1242799866000
14000036	14000000	"Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone."	1242799869500
14000037	14000000	"This Nation is asking for action, and action now."	1242799874000
14000038	14000000	"Our greatest primary task is to put people to work."	1242799878500
16000007	16000000	"It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago."	1242799879500
14000039	14000000	"This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously."	1242799883500
14000040	14000000	"It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing great -- greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural resources."	1242799889500
16000008	16000000	"During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace."	1242799892500
16000009	16000000	"The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces."	1242799905000
16000010	16000000	"I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost."	1242799913500
14000041	14000000	"Hand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land."	1242799914500
16000011	16000000	"In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu."	1242799920000
16000012	16000000	"Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya."	1242799928500
16000013	16000000	"Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong."	1242799933500
14000042	14000000	"Yes, the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products, and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities."	1242799936000
16000014	16000000	"Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam."	1242799937000
16000015	16000000	"Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands."	1242799940000
16000016	16000000	"Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island."	1242799944000
16000017	16000000	"And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island."	1242799947500
14000043	14000000	"It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms."	1242799950000
16000018	16000000	"Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area."	1242799951500
16000019	16000000	"The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves."	1242799957500
14000044	14000000	"It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, the State, and the local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced."	1242799961000
16000020	16000000	"The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation."	1242799962000
14000045	14000000	"It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, unequal."	1242799974000
16000021	16000000	"As commander in chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense."	1242799974500
14000046	14000000	"It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities that have a definitely public character."	1242799982500
16000022	16000000	"But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us."	1242799984500
16000023	16000000	"No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory."	1242799991500
14000047	14000000	"There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped by merely talking about it."	1242799996000
16000024	16000000	"I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us."	1242800004500
14000048	14000000	"We must act."	1242800006500
14000049	14000000	"We must act quickly."	1242800008000
14000050	14000000	"And finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work, we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order."	1242800010000
14000051	14000000	"There must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments."	1242800022000
16000025	16000000	"Hostilities exist."	1242800026000
16000026	16000000	"There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger."	1242800027000
14000052	14000000	"There must be an end to speculation with other people's money."	1242800028500
14000053	14000000	"And there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency."	1242800034000
16000027	16000000	"With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God."	1242800036500
14000054	14000000	"These, my friends, are the lines of attack."	1242800039500
14000055	14000000	"I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the 48 States."	1242800043500
16000028	16000000	"I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire."	1242800048500
14000056	14000000	"Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo."	1242800057000
14000057	14000000	"Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time, and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy."	1242800067500
14000058	14000000	"I favor, as a practical policy, the putting of first things first."	1242800079000
14000059	14000000	"I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment	 but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment."	1242800085000
14000060	14000000	"The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not nationally -- narrowly nationalistic."	1242800096500
14000061	14000000	"It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United Statefestation of the American spirit of the pioneer."	1242800105000
18000001	18000000	"Reverend Meza, Reverend Reck, I'm grateful for your generous invitation to state my views."	1242800105000
18000002	18000000	"While the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight, I want to emphasize from the outset that I believe that we have far more critical issues in the 1960 campaign	 the spread of Communist influence, until it now festers only 90 miles from the coast of Florida -- the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those who no longer respect our power -- the hungry children I saw in West Virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills, the families forced to give up their farms -- an America with too many slums, with too few schools, and too late to the moon and outer space."	1242800112000
14000062	14000000	"It is the way to recovery."	1242800119500
14000063	14000000	"It is the immediate way."	1242800122500
14000064	14000000	"It is the strongest assurance that recovery will endure."	1242800125000
14000065	14000000	"In the field of world policy, I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor: the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others	 the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors."	1242800129500
14000066	14000000	"If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other	 that we can not merely take, but we must give as well	 that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress can be made, no leadership becomes effective."	1242800156500
18000003	18000000	"These are the real issues which should decide this campaign."	1242800170000
18000004	18000000	"And they are not religious issues -- for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier."	1242800175000
18000005	18000000	"But because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected President, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured -- perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this."	1242800184500
14000067	14000000	"We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good."	1242800193500
18000006	18000000	"So it is apparently necessary for me to state once again -- not what kind of church I believe in, for that should be important only to me -- but what kind of America I believe in."	1242800201000
14000068	14000000	"This, I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us, bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife."	1242800208000
18000007	18000000	"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute	 where no Catholic prelate would tell the President -- should he be Catholic -- how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote	 where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him, or the people who might elect him."	1242800219500
14000069	14000000	"With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems."	1242800225500
14000070	14000000	"Action in this image, action to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors."	1242800238000
14000071	14000000	"Our Constitution is so simple, so practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form."	1242800249000
18000008	18000000	"I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish	 where no public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source	 where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials, and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all."	1242800261500
14000072	14000000	"That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has ever seen."	1242800262500
14000073	14000000	"It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations."	1242800273000
14000074	14000000	"And it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly equal, wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us."	1242800283000
14000075	14000000	"But iadership."	1242800297000
14000076	14000000	"They have made me the present instrument of their wishes."	1242800298000
18000009	18000000	"For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been -- and may someday be again -- a Jew, or a Quaker, or a Unitarian, or a Baptist."	1242800302000
14000077	14000000	"In the spirit of the gift I take it."	1242800303000
14000078	14000000	"In this dedication -- In this dedication of a Nation, we humbly ask the blessing of God."	1242800307500
14000079	14000000	"May He protect each and every one of us."	1242800316000
14000080	14000000	"May He guide me in the days to come."	1242800320500
18000010	18000000	"It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that led to Jefferson's statute of religious freedom."	1242800322500
18000011	18000000	"Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril."	1242800331000
18000012	18000000	"Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end, where all men and all churches are treated as equals, where every man has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice, where there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind, and where Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, at both the lay and the pastoral levels, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood."	1242800346500
18000013	18000000	"That is the kind of America in which I believe."	1242800394500
18000014	18000000	"And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believe, a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding it -- its occupancy from the members of any one religious group."	1242800399500
20000001	20000000	"I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished Mayor, who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin."	1242800405000
20000002	20000000	"And I am proud -- And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years has committed Germany to democracy and freedom and progress, and to come here in the company of my fellow American, General Clay, who --     -- who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed."	1242800418500
18000015	18000000	"I believe in a President whose views on religion are his own private affair, neither imposed upon him by the nation, nor imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office."	1242800422000
18000016	18000000	"I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the first amendment's guarantees of religious liberty	 nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do so."	1242800439500
20000003	20000000	"Two thousand years ago -- Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was \"civis Romanus sum.\""	1242800454000
18000017	18000000	"And neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test, even by indirection."	1242800455500
20000004	20000000	"Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\""	1242800462000
18000018	18000000	"For if they disagree with that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it."	1242800469000
20000005	20000000	"I appreciate my interpreter translating my German."	1242800469000
20000006	20000000	"There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world."	1242800472500
18000019	18000000	"I want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none, who can attend any ceremony, service, or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to fulfill	 and whose fulfillment of his Presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath, ritual, or obligation."	1242800476500
20000007	20000000	"Let them come to Berlin."	1242800486500
20000008	20000000	"There are some who say -- There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future."	1242800489000
20000009	20000000	"Let them come to Berlin."	1242800498500
20000010	20000000	"And there are some who say, in Europe and elsewhere, we can work with the Communists."	1242800501000
18000020	18000000	"This is the kind of America I believe in -- and this is the kind of America I fought for in the South Pacific, and the kind my brother died for in Europe."	1242800502500
20000011	20000000	"Let them come to Berlin."	1242800509000
20000012	20000000	"And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress."	1242800511500
18000021	18000000	"No one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty, that we did not believe in liberty, or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened -- I quote -- \"the freedoms for which our forefathers died.\""	1242800519000
20000013	20000000	"Lass' sie nach Berlin kommen."	1242800524500
20000014	20000000	"Let them come to Berlin."	1242800527000
20000015	20000000	"Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect."	1242800529500
20000016	20000000	"But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in -- to prevent them from leaving us."	1242800534000
18000022	18000000	"And in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers did die when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches -- when they fought for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom -- and when they fought at the shrine I visited today, the Alamo."	1242800538500
20000017	20000000	"I want to say on behalf of my countrymen who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride, that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years."	1242800545000
18000023	18000000	"For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died Fuentes, and McCafferty, and Bailey, and Badillo, and Carey -- but no one knows whether they were Catholics or not."	1242800570000
20000018	20000000	"I know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force, and the hope, and the determination of the city of West Berlin."	1242800571500
18000024	18000000	"For there was no religious test there."	1242800584500
18000025	18000000	"I ask you tonight to follow in that tradition -- to judge me on the basis of 14 years in the Congress, on my declared stands against an Ambassador to the Vatican, against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools, and against any boycott of the public schools -- which I attended myself."	1242800588000
20000019	20000000	"While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system -- for all the world to see -- we take no satisfaction in it	 for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together."	1242800589000
18000026	18000000	"And instead of doing this, do not judge me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of Catholic church leaders, usually in other countries, frequently in other centuries, and rarely relevant to any situation here."	1242800613500
20000020	20000000	"What is -- What is true of this city is true of Germany: Real, lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice."	1242800624000
18000027	18000000	"And always omitting, of course, the statement of the American Bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed Church-State separation, and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic."	1242800638500
20000021	20000000	"In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people."	1242800647000
18000028	18000000	"I do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts."	1242800653500
18000029	18000000	"Why should you?"	1242800659500
18000030	18000000	"But let me say, with respect to other countries, that I am wholly opposed to the State being used by any religious group, Catholic or Protestant, to compel, prohibit, or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion."	1242800661000
20000022	20000000	"You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main."	1242800666000
20000023	20000000	"So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind."	1242800674000
18000031	18000000	"And that goes for any persecution, at any time, by anyone, in any country."	1242800680000
18000032	18000000	"And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their Presidency to Protestants, and those which deny it to Catholics."	1242800687000
18000033	18000000	"And rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ, I would also cite the record of the Catholic Church in such nations as France and Ireland, and the independence of such statesmen as De Gaulle and Adenauer."	1242800700000
20000024	20000000	"Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free."	1242800703500
22000001	22000000	"Vice President Johnson, Mr."	1242800705000
22000002	22000000	"Speaker, Mr."	1242800707000
22000003	22000000	"Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens:  We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal, as well as change."	1242800708000
20000025	20000000	"When all are free, then we look -- can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe."	1242800710000
18000034	18000000	"But let me stress again that these are my views."	1242800719000
18000035	18000000	"For contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for President."	1242800724000
20000026	20000000	"When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades."	1242800728500
22000004	22000000	"For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago."	1242800729500
18000036	18000000	"I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic."	1242800731000
18000037	18000000	"I do not speak for my church on public matters	 and the church does not speak for me."	1242800738500
22000005	22000000	"The world is very different now."	1242800740500
22000006	22000000	"For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life."	1242800743500
20000027	20000000	"All -- All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin."	1242800744000
18000038	18000000	"Whatever issue may come before me as President, if I should be elected, on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject, I will make my decision in accordance with these views -- in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates."	1242800747500
20000028	20000000	"And, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\""	1242800750500
22000007	22000000	"And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God."	1242800754500
22000008	22000000	"We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution."	1242800774500
18000039	18000000	"And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise."	1242800776000
22000009	22000000	"Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world."	1242800781500
18000040	18000000	"But if the time should ever come -- and I do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible -- when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office	 and I hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise."	1242800782500
18000041	18000000	"But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant faith	 nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election."	1242800808500
22000010	22000000	"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty."	1242800822000
18000042	18000000	"If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I'd tried my best and was fairly judged."	1242800827000
18000043	18000000	"But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people."	1242800840500
22000011	22000000	"This much we pledge -- and more."	1242800841000
22000012	22000000	"To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends."	1242800844500
22000013	22000000	"United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures."	1242800853500
22000014	22000000	"Divided there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder."	1242800860000
18000044	18000000	"But if, on the other hand, I should win this election, then I shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency -- practically identical, I might add, with the oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress."	1242800870000
22000015	22000000	"To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny."	1242800870500
22000016	22000000	"We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view."	1242800889500
18000045	18000000	"For without reservation, I can, \"solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution -- so help me God. "	1242800893000
22000017	22000000	"But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside."	1242800895000
22000018	22000000	"To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required -- not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right."	1242800913000
22000019	22000000	"If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich."	1242800940500
22000020	22000000	"To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge: to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress, to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty."	1242800950000
22000021	22000000	"But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers."	1242800970500
22000022	22000000	"Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas."	1242800977000
22000023	22000000	"And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house."	1242800987000
22000024	22000000	"To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective, to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run."	1242800996000
24000001	24000000	"Mr."	1242801005000
24000002	24000000	"Moderator, Brother Lomax, brothers and sisters, friends and enemies: I just can't believe everyone in here is a friend, and I don't want to leave anybody out."	1242801005500
24000003	24000000	"The question tonight, as I understand it, is \"The Negro Revolt, and Where Do We Go From Here?\""	1242801019000
24000004	24000000	"or What Next?"	1242801028000
22000025	22000000	"Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction."	1242801029500
24000005	24000000	"In my little humble way of understanding it, it points toward either the ballot or the bullet."	1242801029500
24000006	24000000	"Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify something concerning myself."	1242801038000
24000007	24000000	"I'm still a Muslim	 my religion is still Islam."	1242801049000
22000026	22000000	"We dare not tempt them with weakness."	1242801051500
24000008	24000000	"That's my personal belief."	1242801053500
22000027	22000000	"For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed."	1242801055000
24000009	24000000	"Just as Adam Clayton Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country	 and Dr."	1242801055500
22000028	22000000	"But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war."	1242801065500
24000010	24000000	"Martin Luther King is a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country	 and Reverend Galamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education	 well, I myself am a minister, not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister	 and I believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary."	1242801077500
22000029	22000000	"So let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof."	1242801093000
22000030	22000000	"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate."	1242801105500
22000031	22000000	"Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us."	1242801112500
24000011	24000000	"Although I'm still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my religion."	1242801118000
22000032	22000000	"Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations."	1242801120500
24000012	24000000	"I'm not here to try and change your religion."	1242801124500
24000013	24000000	"I'm not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem, a problem that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist."	1242801129000
22000033	22000000	"Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors."	1242801138000
22000034	22000000	"Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce."	1242801145000
22000035	22000000	"Let both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of Isaiah -- to \"undo the heavy burdens, and [to] let the oppressed go free.\""	1242801155500
24000014	24000000	"Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am."	1242801160000
22000036	22000000	"And, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor -- not a new balance of power, but a new world of law -- where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved."	1242801170000
24000015	24000000	"We're all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man."	1242801172000
24000016	24000000	"He just happens to be a white man."	1242801182000
24000017	24000000	"All of us have suffered here, in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white man, economic exploitation at the hands of the white man, and social degradation at the hands of the white man."	1242801186000
22000037	22000000	"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days."	1242801194500
22000038	22000000	"Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days	 nor in the life of this Administration	 nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet."	1242801200500
24000018	24000000	"Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're anti-white, but it does mean we're anti-exploitation, we're anti-degradation, we're anti-oppression."	1242801204500
22000039	22000000	"But let us begin."	1242801214000
24000019	24000000	"And if the white man doesn't want us to be anti-him, let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us."	1242801215000
22000040	22000000	"In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course."	1242801216000
24000020	24000000	"Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences."	1242801225000
22000041	22000000	"Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty."	1242801225500

24000021	24000000	"If we have differences, let us differ in the closet	 when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man."	1242801235000
22000043	22000000	"Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- not as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \"rejoicing in hope	 patient in tribulation,\" a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself."	1242801242000
24000022	24000000	"If the late President Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other."	1242801251000
24000023	24000000	"If we don't do something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet."	1242801266500
22000044	22000000	"Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?"	1242801275500
24000024	24000000	"It's one or the other in 1964."	1242801280000
24000025	24000000	"It isn't that time is running out -- time has run out!"	1242801283500
22000045	22000000	"Will you join in that historic effort?"	1242801289000
24000026	24000000	"1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed."	1242801289500
22000046	22000000	"In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger."	1242801292500
24000027	24000000	"The most explosive year."	1242801295500
24000028	24000000	"Why?"	1242801297500
24000029	24000000	"It's also a political year."	1242801298000
24000030	24000000	"It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community jiving you and me for some votes."	1242801300500
22000047	22000000	"I do not shrink from this responsibility -- I welcome it."	1242801305000
26000001	26000000	"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation."	1242801305000
22000048	22000000	"I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation."	1242801310500
24000031	24000000	"The year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep."	1242801312500
26000002	26000000	"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation."	1242801318500
22000049	22000000	"The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it."	1242801320000
26000003	26000000	"This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice."	1242801327500
22000050	22000000	"And the glow from that fire can truly light the world."	1242801330500
24000032	24000000	"As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion	 and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today -- I'm sorry, Brother Lomax -- who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer."	1242801335000
22000051	22000000	"And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you	 ask what you can do for your country."	1242801336000
26000004	26000000	"It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity."	1242801340500
22000052	22000000	"My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America wessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own."	1242801347000
26000005	26000000	"But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free."	1242801347500
26000006	26000000	"One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."	1242801353000
24000033	24000000	"Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you."	1242801358000
24000034	24000000	"If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese."	1242801364000
26000007	26000000	"One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."	1242801364500
24000035	24000000	"If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here."	1242801372000
26000008	26000000	"One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land."	1242801376000
24000036	24000000	"These odds aren't as great as those odds."	1242801378500
24000037	24000000	"And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for."	1242801382500
26000009	26000000	"And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition."	1242801388000
24000038	24000000	"I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics	 in fact, I'm not a student of much of anything."	1242801389500
26000010	26000000	"In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check."	1242801393500
24000039	24000000	"I'm not a Democrat."	1242801399500
26000011	26000000	"When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir."	1242801400000
24000040	24000000	"I'm not a Republican, and I don't even consider myself an American."	1242801401500
24000041	24000000	"If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem."	1242801407500
24000042	24000000	"Those Honkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans	 Polacks are already Americans	 the Italian refugees are already Americans."	1242801412500
26000012	26000000	"This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\""	1242801416000
24000043	24000000	"Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is already an American."	1242801423000
24000044	24000000	"And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet."	1242801429500
26000013	26000000	"It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned."	1242801431000
24000045	24000000	"Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself."	1242801437000
26000014	26000000	"Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\""	1242801441000
24000046	24000000	"I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner."	1242801442000
24000047	24000000	"Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate."	1242801453000
26000015	26000000	"But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt."	1242801453000
26000016	26000000	"We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation."	1242801459000
24000048	24000000	"Being here in America doesn't make you an American."	1242801462000
24000049	24000000	"Being born here in America doesn't make you an American."	1242801466500
26000017	26000000	"And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice."	1242801468000
24000050	24000000	"Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation	 you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution	 you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D."	1242801471500
26000018	26000000	"We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now."	1242801480500
24000051	24000000	"C."	1242801486000
24000052	24000000	"right now."	1242801486500
24000053	24000000	"They don't have to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American."	1242801487500
26000019	26000000	"This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism."	1242801489000
24000054	24000000	"No, I'm not an American."	1242801494000
24000055	24000000	"I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism."	1242801496500
26000020	26000000	"Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy."	1242801499000
24000056	24000000	"One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy."	1242801503500
26000021	26000000	"Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice."	1242801504500
24000057	24000000	"So, I'm not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver -- no, not I."	1242801512000
26000022	26000000	"Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood."	1242801515000
24000058	24000000	"I'm speaking as a victim of this American system."	1242801524000
26000023	26000000	"Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children."	1242801525000
24000059	24000000	"And I see America through the eyes of the victim."	1242801528500
26000024	26000000	"It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment."	1242801532000
24000060	24000000	"I don't see any American dream	 I see an American nightmare."	1242801533500
24000061	24000000	"These 22 million victims are waking up."	1242801539000
26000025	26000000	"This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality."	1242801539000
24000062	24000000	"Their eyes are coming open."	1242801542500
24000063	24000000	"They're beginning to see what they used to only look at."	1242801545000
26000026	26000000	"Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning."	1242801549500
24000064	24000000	"They're becoming politically mature."	1242801550500
24000065	24000000	"They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast."	1242801552500
26000027	26000000	"And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual."	1242801554000
24000066	24000000	"As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount."	1242801559000
26000028	26000000	"And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights."	1242801569000
24000067	24000000	"They had to recount in Massachusetts to see who was going to be governor, it was so close."	1242801574500
26000029	26000000	"The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges."	1242801578000
24000068	24000000	"It was the same way in Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country."	1242801583500
26000030	26000000	"But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds."	1242801588000
24000069	24000000	"And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president."	1242801592500
24000070	24000000	"It was so close they had to count all over again."	1242801598500
24000071	24000000	"Well, what does this mean?"	1242801604000
28000001	28000000	"My Fellow Americans,  I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency and as a man whose honesty and -- and integrity has been questioned."	1242801605000
24000072	24000000	"It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the dog house."	1242801606500
26000031	26000000	"Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred."	1242801608000
26000032	26000000	"We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline."	1242801617500
28000002	28000000	"Now, the usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details."	1242801619500
26000033	26000000	"We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence."	1242801624500
24000073	24000000	"lt."	1242801629000
24000074	24000000	"was the black man's vote that put the present administration in Washington, D."	1242801629500
26000034	26000000	"Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force."	1242801630500
28000003	28000000	"I believe we've had enough of that in the United States, particularly with the present Administration in Washington, D."	1242801632000
24000075	24000000	"C."	1242801636000
24000076	24000000	"Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D."	1242801636500
26000035	26000000	"The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny."	1242801639000
28000004	28000000	"C."	1242801641500
28000005	28000000	"To me the office of the Vice Presidency of the United States is a great office, and I feel that the people have got to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it."	1242801642000
24000077	24000000	"C."	1242801645500
24000078	24000000	"that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that."	1242801646000
24000079	24000000	"And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're making."	1242801656500
26000036	26000000	"And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom."	1242801662500
28000006	28000000	"I have a theory, too, that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth."	1242801663500
24000080	24000000	"And what a good president we have."	1242801667500
26000037	26000000	"We cannot walk alone."	1242801670000
24000081	24000000	"If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in Washington, D."	1242801671000
26000038	26000000	"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead."	1242801672000
28000007	28000000	"And that's why I'm here tonight."	1242801677000
24000082	24000000	"C."	1242801678000
24000083	24000000	"Because Texas is a lynch state."	1242801678500
26000039	26000000	"We cannot turn back."	1242801679500
28000008	28000000	"I want to tell you my side of the case."	1242801680000
24000084	24000000	"It is in the same breath as Mississippi, no different	 only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi accent."	1242801681500
26000040	26000000	"There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\""	1242801681500
28000009	28000000	"I'm sure that you have read the charge, and you've heard it, that I, Senator Nixon, took 18,000 dollars from a group of my supporters."	1242801685000
26000041	26000000	"We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality."	1242801689500
24000085	24000000	"And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker -- that's all he is -- and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners."	1242801696000
28000010	28000000	"Now, was that wrong?"	1242801697500
26000042	26000000	"We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities."	1242801699500
28000011	28000000	"And let me say that it was wrong."	1242801699500
28000012	28000000	"I'm saying, incidentally, that it was wrong, not just illegal, because it isn't a question of whether it was legal or illegal, that isn't enough."	1242801703500
26000043	26000000	"We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one."	1242801715000
28000013	28000000	"The question is, was it morally wrong?"	1242801716000
28000014	28000000	"I say that it was morally wrong -- if any of that 18,000 dollars went to Senator Nixon, for my personal use."	1242801719500
26000044	26000000	"We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\""	1242801725000
24000086	24000000	"What kind of logic is that?"	1242801726000
24000087	24000000	"Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too."	1242801729000
28000015	28000000	"I say that it was morally wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled."	1242801730500
24000088	24000000	"He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson."	1242801733500
26000045	26000000	"We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote."	1242801738000
28000016	28000000	"And I say that it was morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made."	1242801738000
24000089	24000000	"In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans."	1242801739000
24000090	24000000	"They control two-thirds of the House vote."	1242801747500
28000017	28000000	"And now to answer those questions let me say this: Not one cent of the 18,000 dollars or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use."	1242801749000
24000091	24000000	"Why can't they pass something that will help you and me?"	1242801751000
26000046	26000000	"No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\""	1242801751500
24000092	24000000	"In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party."	1242801756500
24000093	24000000	"Only 33 of them are Republicans."	1242801763000
26000047	26000000	"I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations."	1242801763500
28000018	28000000	"Every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that I did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the United States."	1242801765000
24000094	24000000	"Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them."	1242801766000
26000048	26000000	"Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells."	1242801772000
24000095	24000000	"And what have they given you for it?"	1242801775500
26000049	26000000	"And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality."	1242801777000
28000019	28000000	"It was not a secret fund."	1242801778000
24000096	24000000	"Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation."	1242801779500
28000020	28000000	"As a matter of  fact, when I was on \"Meet the Press\" -- some of you may have seen it last Sunday -- Peter Edson came up to me after the program, and he said, \"Dick, what about this \"fund\" we hear about?\""	1242801781000
24000097	24000000	"Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster."	1242801786000
26000050	26000000	"You have been the veterans of creative suffering."	1242801792500
26000051	26000000	"Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive."	1242801796500
26000052	26000000	"Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed."	1242801802000
28000021	28000000	"And I said, \"Well, there's no secret about it. Go out and see Dana Smith who was the administrator of the fund.\""	1242801803000
24000098	24000000	"All those are in cahoots together."	1242801803500
24000099	24000000	"Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man from Georgia named Richard Russell."	1242801806500
28000022	28000000	"And I gave him [Edson] his [Smith's] address."	1242801814000
28000023	28000000	"And I said you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was to defray political expenses that I did not feel should be charged to the Government."	1242801818000
24000100	24000000	"When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D."	1242801819500
26000053	26000000	"Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends."	1242801823000
24000101	24000000	"C."	1242801828000
24000102	24000000	"was \"Dicky\" -- that's how tight they are."	1242801828500
26000054	26000000	"And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream."	1242801831000
24000103	24000000	"That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy."	1242801832500
28000024	28000000	"And third, let me point out -- and I want to make this particularly clear -- that no contributor to this fund, no contributor to any of my campaigns, has ever received any consideration that he would not have received as an ordinary constituent."	1242801832500
24000104	24000000	"But they're playing that old con game."	1242801837000
26000055	26000000	"It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream."	1242801839500
24000105	24000000	"One of them makes believe he's for you, and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise."	1242801840500
26000056	26000000	"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\""	1242801844500
28000025	28000000	"I just don't believe in that, and I can say that never, while I have been in the Senate of the United States, as far as the people that contributed to this fund are concerned, have I made a telephone call for them to an agency, or have I gone down to an agency in their behalf."	1242801854500
24000106	24000000	"So it's time in 1964 to wake up."	1242801855000
24000107	24000000	"And when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open."	1242801859000
26000057	26000000	"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood."	1242801861500
24000108	24000000	"And let them know you -- something else that's wide open too."	1242801868500
24000109	24000000	"It's got to be the ballot or the bullet."	1242801874500
24000110	24000000	"The ballot or the bullet."	1242801879000
26000058	26000000	"I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice."	1242801880000
24000111	24000000	"If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the country	 you should get back in the cotton patch	 you should get back in the alley."	1242801881500
28000026	28000000	"And the records will show that, the records which are in the hands of the administration."	1242801883000
28000027	28000000	"Well, then, some of you will say, and rightly, \"Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator?\""	1242801891000
24000112	24000000	"They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return."	1242801897500
26000059	26000000	"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."	1242801898000
28000028	28000000	"Why did you have to have it?"	1242801900000
28000029	28000000	"Let me tell you in just a word how a Senate office operates."	1242801903500
30000001	30000000	"Good evening, my fellow Americans."	1242801905000
24000113	24000000	"All they did when they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs."	1242801906000
30000002	30000000	"Tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts of the world, the war in Vietnam."	1242801907500
28000030	28000000	"First of all, a Senator gets 15,000 dollars a year in salary."	1242801910000
24000114	24000000	"Those big Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs."	1242801914000
26000060	26000000	"I have a dream today!"	1242801915500
28000031	28000000	"He gets enough money to pay for one trip a year -- a round trip, that is -- for himself and his family between his home and Washington, D."	1242801916000
26000061	26000000	"I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."	1242801918000
24000115	24000000	"That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing."	1242801919500
30000003	30000000	"I believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans have lost confidence in what their Government has told them about our policy."	1242801922500
24000116	24000000	"I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans."	1242801923000
24000117	24000000	"We'll get to them in a minute."	1242801928500
28000032	28000000	"C."	1242801930500
28000033	28000000	"And then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office to handle his mail."	1242801931000
24000118	24000000	"But it is true	 you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last."	1242801932000
30000004	30000000	"The American people cannot and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy."	1242801937500
24000119	24000000	"Look at it the way it is."	1242801939500
28000034	28000000	"And the allowance for my State of California is enough to hire 13 people."	1242801940500
24000120	24000000	"What alibis do they use, since they control Congress and the Senate?"	1242801943000
26000062	26000000	"I have a dream today!"	1242801947000
28000035	28000000	"And let me say, incidentally, that that allowance is not paid to the Senator."	1242801947500
24000121	24000000	"What alibi do they use when you and I ask, \"Well, when are you going to keep your promise?\""	1242801949000
26000063	26000000	"I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight	 \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\""	1242801949500
30000005	30000000	"Tonight, therefore, I would like to answer some of the questions that I know are on the minds of many of you listening to me."	1242801952500
28000036	28000000	"It's paid directly to the individuals that the Senator puts on his pay roll."	1242801954500
24000122	24000000	"They blame the Dixiecrats."	1242801958500
24000123	24000000	"What is a Dixiecrat?"	1242801960500
28000037	28000000	"But all of these people and all of these allowances are for strictly official business	 business, for example, when a constituent writes in and wants you to go down to the Veteran's Administration and get some information about his GI policy -- items of that type, for example."	1242801961500
24000124	24000000	"A Democrat."	1242801962500
24000125	24000000	"A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise."	1242801963500
30000006	30000000	"How and why did America get involved in Vietnam in the first place?"	1242801965000
24000126	24000000	"The titular head of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats, because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Democratic Party."	1242801968000
30000007	30000000	"How has this administration changed the policy of the previous Administration?"	1242801971500
26000064	26000000	"2  This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with."	1242801975500
30000008	30000000	"What has really happened in the negotiations in Paris and on the battlefront in Vietnam?"	1242801977000
24000127	24000000	"The Democrats have never kicked the Dixiecrats out of the party."	1242801979500
30000009	30000000	"What choices do we have if we are to end the war?"	1242801984500
24000128	24000000	"The Dixiecrats bolted themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out."	1242801985000
26000065	26000000	"With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope."	1242801985000
28000038	28000000	"But there are other expenses which are not covered by the Government."	1242801985500
30000010	30000000	"What are the prospects for peace?"	1242801990500
24000129	24000000	"Imagine, these lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down."	1242801991000
28000039	28000000	"And I think I can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions."	1242801991500
30000011	30000000	"Now let me begin by describing the situation I found when I was inaugurated on January 20: The war had been going on for four years."	1242801993500
26000066	26000000	"With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood."	1242801994500
24000130	24000000	"But the Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down."	1242801996000
28000040	28000000	"Do you think that when I or any other Senator makes a political speech, has it printed, should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers?"	1242801998500
24000131	24000000	"No, look at that thing the way it is."	1242802001000
26000067	26000000	"With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day."	1242802005000
24000132	24000000	"They have got a con game going on, a political con game, and you and I are in the middle."	1242802005500
30000012	30000000	"Thirty-one thousand Americans had been killed in action."	1242802006500
30000013	30000000	"The training program for the South Vietnamese was beyond [behind] schedule."	1242802010500
28000041	28000000	"Do you think, for example, when I or any other Senator makes a trip to his home State to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers?"	1242802015000
24000133	24000000	"It's time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is	 and then we can deal with it like it is."	1242802015500
30000014	30000000	"Five hundred and forty-thousand Americans were in Vietnam with no plans to reduce the number."	1242802016000
26000068	26000000	"And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:      My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing."	1242802022500
30000015	30000000	"No progress had been made at the negotiations in Paris and the United States had not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal."	1242802023500
24000134	24000000	"The Dixiecrats in Washington, D."	1242802033000
28000042	28000000	"Do you think when a Senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts, radio or television, that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers?"	1242802033000
30000016	30000000	"The war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends, as well as our enemies, abroad."	1242802034500
24000135	24000000	"C."	1242802035500
24000136	24000000	"control the key committees that run the government."	1242802036000
24000137	24000000	"The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority."	1242802040000
26000069	26000000	"Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,      From every mountainside, let freedom ring!"	1242802044000
30000017	30000000	"In view of these circumstances, there were some who urged that I end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all American forces."	1242802045000
24000138	24000000	"The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can't vote."	1242802046500
28000043	28000000	"Well I know what your answer is."	1242802047000
28000044	28000000	"It's the same answer that audiences give me whenever I discuss this particular problem: The answer is no."	1242802050500
24000139	24000000	"This is not even a government that's based on democracy."	1242802054500
26000070	26000000	"And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true."	1242802054500
30000018	30000000	"From a political standpoint, this would have been a popular and easy course to follow."	1242802058000
24000140	24000000	"lt."	1242802059500
28000045	28000000	"The taxpayers shouldn't be required to finance items which are not official business but which are primarily political business."	1242802059500

26000071	26000000	"And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire."	1242802061000
30000019	30000000	"After all, we became involved in the war while my predecessor was in office."	1242802065500
24000142	24000000	"Half of the people in the South can't even vote."	1242802066500
26000072	26000000	"Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York."	1242802067000
28000046	28000000	"Well, then the question arises, you say, \"Well, how do you pay for these and how can you do it legally?\""	1242802069000
24000143	24000000	"Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington."	1242802071500
26000073	26000000	"Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania."	1242802072000
30000020	30000000	"I could blame the defeat, which would be the result of my action, on him -- and come out as the peacemaker."	1242802072500

30000021	30000000	"Some put it to me quite bluntly: This was the only way to avoid allowing Johnson's war to become Nixon's war."	1242802083500
26000076	26000000	"But not only that:      Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia."	1242802085500
24000147	24000000	"I was in Washington, D."	1242802086500
24000148	24000000	"C."	1242802089000
24000149	24000000	"a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor."	1242802089500
28000048	28000000	"The first way is to be a rich man."	1242802092500
26000077	26000000	"Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee."	1242802094000
30000022	30000000	"But I had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of my Administration, and of the next election."	1242802094000
28000049	28000000	"I don't happen to be a rich man, so I couldn't use that one."	1242802097000
26000078	26000000	"Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi."	1242802098000
24000150	24000000	"And in the back of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country."	1242802099500
26000079	26000000	"From every mountainside, let freedom ring."	1242802103000
28000050	28000000	"Another way that is used is to put your wife on the pay roll."	1242802104000
30000023	30000000	"I had to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation, and on the future of peace and freedom in America, and in the world."	1242802104500
26000080	26000000	"And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:                  Free at last!"	1242802106000
28000051	28000000	"Let me say, incidentally, that my opponent, my opposite number for the Vice Presidency on the Democratic ticket, does have his wife on the pay roll and has had it -- her on his pay roll for the ten years -- for the past ten years."	1242802111000
24000151	24000000	"And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to vote."	1242802115500
30000024	30000000	"Let us all understand that the question before us is not whether some Americans are for peace and some Americans are against peace."	1242802118500
30000025	30000000	"The question at issue is not whether Johnson's war becomes Nixon's war."	1242802130000
28000052	28000000	"Now just let me say this: That's his business, and I'm not critical of him for doing that."	1242802134000
30000026	30000000	"The great question is: How can we win America's peace?"	1242802136000
24000152	24000000	"This is pitiful."	1242802138500
24000153	24000000	"But it's not pitiful for us any longer	 it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic."	1242802140000
30000027	30000000	"Well, let us turn now to the fundamental issue: Why and how did the United States become involved in Vietnam in the first place?"	1242802141000
28000053	28000000	"You will have to pass judgment on that particular point."	1242802143000
28000054	28000000	"But I have never done that for this reason: I have found that there are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in Washington that needed the work that I just didn't feel it was right to put my wife on the pay roll."	1242802148000
26000081	26000000	"Free at last!"	1242802149500
26000082	26000000	"Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"	1242802151000
30000028	30000000	"Fifteen years ago North Vietnam, with the logistical support of Communist China and the Soviet Union, launched a campaign to impose a Communist government on South Vietnam by instigating and supporting a revolution."	1242802153000
24000154	24000000	"These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote."	1242802167000
28000055	28000000	"My wife's sitting over here."	1242802169500
30000029	30000000	"In response to the request of the Government of South Vietnam, President Eisenhower sent economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of South Vietnam in their efforts to prevent a Communist takeover."	1242802169500
28000056	28000000	"She's a wonderful stenographer."	1242802172000
28000057	28000000	"She used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school."	1242802174000
24000155	24000000	"And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated."	1242802178500
28000058	28000000	"That was when I met her."	1242802181000
28000059	28000000	"And I can tell you folks that she's worked many hours at night and many hours on Saturdays and Sundays in my office, and she's done a fine job, and I am proud to say tonight that in the six years I've been in the House and the Senate of the United States, Pat Nixon has never been on the Government pay roll."	1242802184000
30000030	30000000	"Seven years ago, President Kennedy sent 16,000 military personnel to Vietnam as combat advisers."	1242802186500
24000156	24000000	"You don't even need new legislation."	1242802191000
30000031	30000000	"Four years ago, President Johnson sent American combat forces to South Vietnam."	1242802193500
24000157	24000000	"Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from Congress."	1242802194000
30000032	30000000	"Now many believe that President Johnson's decision to send American combat forces to South Vietnam was wrong."	1242802199500
32000001	32000000	"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans."	1242802205000
30000033	30000000	"And many others, I among them, have been strongly critical of the way the war has been conducted."	1242802208000
24000158	24000000	"And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country."	1242802210000
28000060	28000000	"What are other ways that these finances can be taken care of?"	1242802215500
30000034	30000000	"But the question facing us today is: Now that we are in the war, what is the best way to end it?"	1242802217000
32000002	32000000	"Today is a day for mourning and remembering."	1242802220500
24000159	24000000	"In fact, when you expel them, you don't need new legislation, because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority, not in the minority."	1242802221000
28000061	28000000	"Some who are lawyers, and I happen to be a lawyer, continue to practice law, but I haven't been able to do that."	1242802221500
32000003	32000000	"Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger."	1242802224500
30000035	30000000	"In January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of all American forces from Vietnam would be a disaster not only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the cause of peace."	1242802228000
32000004	32000000	"We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country."	1242802232000
28000062	28000000	"I'm so far away from California that I've been so busy with my senatorial work that I have not engaged in any legal practice."	1242802233000
24000160	24000000	"If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights, the key Dixiecrats in Washington, D."	1242802238500
32000005	32000000	"This is truly a national loss."	1242802239000
32000006	32000000	"Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground."	1242802242000
28000063	28000000	"And, also, as far as law practice is concerned, it seemed to me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was so personal that you couldn't possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that he had one before Government."	1242802245000
30000036	30000000	"For the South Vietnamese, our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the Communists to repeat the massacres which followed their takeover in the North 15 years before."	1242802246000
24000161	24000000	"C."	1242802248000
24000162	24000000	"which means the key Democrats in Washington, D."	1242802248500
32000007	32000000	"But we've never lost an astronaut in flight."	1242802251000
24000163	24000000	"C."	1242802252500
24000164	24000000	"would lose their seats."	1242802253000
24000165	24000000	"The Democratic Party itself would lose its power."	1242802255000
32000008	32000000	"We've never had a tragedy like this."	1242802255000
32000009	32000000	"And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle."	1242802258500
24000166	24000000	"It would cease to be powerful as a party."	1242802259000
30000037	30000000	"They then murdered more than 50,000 people and hundreds of thousands more died in slave labor camps."	1242802259000
24000167	24000000	"When you see the amount of power that would be lost by the Democratic Party if it were to lose the Dixiecrat wing, or branch, or element, you can see where it's against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the Civil War."	1242802263500
32000010	32000000	"But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly."	1242802265500
30000038	30000000	"We saw a prelude of what would happen in South Vietnam when the Communists entered the city of Hue last year."	1242802267500
28000064	28000000	"And so I felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my message to the American people and the speeches I made -- the speeches that I had printed for the most part concerned this one message of exposing this Administration, the Communism in it, the corruption in it -- the only way that I could do that was to accept the aid which people in my home State of California, who contributed to my campaign and who continued to make these contributions after I was elected, were glad to make."	1242802273500
32000011	32000000	"We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe."	1242802274500
30000039	30000000	"During their brief rule there, there was a bloody reign of terror in which 3,000 civilians were clubbed, shot to death, and buried in mass graves."	1242802278000
32000012	32000000	"We mourn their loss as a nation together."	1242802284000
32000013	32000000	"For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy."	1242802288000
30000040	30000000	"With the sudden collapse of our support, these atrocities at Hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the million-and-a half Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam when the Communists took over in the North."	1242802291000
24000168	24000000	"You just can't belong to that Party without analyzing it."	1242802294000
32000014	32000000	"But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much."	1242802297000
24000169	24000000	"I say again, I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti-Republican, I'm not anti-anything."	1242802299000
32000015	32000000	"Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\""	1242802303500
24000170	24000000	"I'm just questioning their sincerity, and some of the strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises that they don't intend to keep."	1242802305000
30000041	30000000	"For the United States this first defeat in our nation's history would result in a collapse of confidence in American leadership not only in Asia but throughout the world."	1242802311000
32000016	32000000	"They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths."	1242802317500
24000171	24000000	"When you keep the Democrats in power, you're keeping the Dixiecrats in power."	1242802318500
28000065	28000000	"And let me say I'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special favor."	1242802321500
32000017	32000000	"They wished to serve, and they did."	1242802323500
24000172	24000000	"I doubt that my good Brother Lomax will deny that."	1242802325000
30000042	30000000	"Three American Presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in Vietnam and understood what had to be done."	1242802325500
32000018	32000000	"They served all of us."	1242802327000
32000019	32000000	"We've grown used to wonders in this century."	1242802329500
24000173	24000000	"A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat."	1242802330000
28000066	28000000	"I'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other than of my own conscience would dictate."	1242802332500
32000020	32000000	"It's hard to dazzle us."	1242802333500
30000043	30000000	"In 1963 President Kennedy with his characteristic eloquence and clarity said,      \"We want to see a stable Government there,\" carrying on the [a] struggle to maintain its national independence."	1242802334500
24000174	24000000	"That's why, in 1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for	 what we're supposed to get when we cast a ballot	 and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet."	1242802335500
32000021	32000000	"But for twenty-five years the United States space program has been doing just that."	1242802336000
32000022	32000000	"We've grown used to the idea of space, and, perhaps we forget that we've only just begun."	1242802343000
28000067	28000000	"And I am proud of the fact that the taxpayers, by subterfuge or otherwise, have never paid one dime for expenses which I thought were political and shouldn't be charged to the taxpayers."	1242802346000
30000044	30000000	"We believe strongly in that."	1242802351500
32000023	32000000	"We're still pioneers."	1242802351500
32000024	32000000	"They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers."	1242802353000
30000045	30000000	"We are not going to withdraw from that effort."	1242802354000
32000025	32000000	"And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's take-off."	1242802357500
30000046	30000000	"In my opinion, for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of South Vietnam but Southeast Asia."	1242802358500
28000068	28000000	"Let me say, incidentally, that some of you may say, \"Well, that's all right, Senator, that's your explanation, but have you got any proof?\""	1242802362500
24000175	24000000	"It's either a ballot or a bullet."	1242802364500
24000176	24000000	"In the North, they do it a different way."	1242802368000
32000026	32000000	"I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen."	1242802368000
30000047	30000000	"So we're going to stay there."	1242802369500
24000177	24000000	"They have a system that's known as gerrymandering, whatever that means."	1242802372500
30000048	30000000	"President Eisenhower and President Johnson expressed the same conclusion during their terms of office."	1242802372500
28000069	28000000	"And I'd like to tell you this evening that just an hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund."	1242802374500
32000027	32000000	"It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery."	1242802374500
24000178	24000000	"It means when Negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines."	1242802378000
30000049	30000000	"For the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would be a disaster of immense magnitude."	1242802379500
32000028	32000000	"It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons."	1242802379500
32000029	32000000	"The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted	 it belongs to the brave."	1242802385000
28000070	28000000	"I suggested to Governor Sherman Adams, who is the Chief of Staff of the Dwight Eisenhower campaign, that an independent audit and legal report be obtained, and I have that audit here in my hands."	1242802385500
30000050	30000000	"A nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends."	1242802386500
32000030	32000000	"The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."	1242802391000
24000179	24000000	"You may say, \"Why do you keep saying white man?\""	1242802393000
30000051	30000000	"Our defeat and humiliation in South Vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of worlds conquest."	1242802394000
24000180	24000000	"Because it's the white man who does it."	1242802398000
32000031	32000000	"I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program."	1242802398500
24000181	24000000	"I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines."	1242802402000
28000071	28000000	"It's an audit made by the Price Waterhouse & Company firm, and the legal opinion by Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher, lawyers in Los Angeles, the biggest law firm, and incidentally, one of the best ones in Los Angeles."	1242802403000
32000032	32000000	"And what happened today does nothing to diminish it."	1242802404500
24000182	24000000	"They don't let him get near the line."	1242802406500
30000052	30000000	"This would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace -- in the Middle East, in Berlin, eventually even in the Western Hemisphere."	1242802408500
32000033	32000000	"We don't hide our space program."	1242802409000
24000183	24000000	"It's the white man who does this."	1242802410500
32000034	32000000	"We don't keep secrets and cover things up."	1242802412000
24000184	24000000	"And usually, it's the white man who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and is supposed to be your friend."	1242802414000
32000035	32000000	"We do it all up front and in public."	1242802416000
30000053	30000000	"Ultimately, this would cost more lives."	1242802420500

28000079	28000000	"And I want you to know the facts."	1242802620000
24000213	24000000	"We're not even as far up as we were in 1954."	1242802621000
28000080	28000000	"I'll have to start early."	1242802624000

24000215	24000000	"There's more segregation now than there was in 1954."	1242802630000
24000216	24000000	"There's more racial animosity, more racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954."	1242802634500
28000083	28000000	"It was a grocery store, one of those family enterprises."	1242802640000
30000078	30000000	"Kissinger, Ambassador Lodge and I personally have met on a number of occasions with representatives of the Soviet Government to enlist their assistance in getting meaningful negotiations started."	1242802641500
24000217	24000000	"Where is the progress?"	1242802643500
28000084	28000000	"The only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dad had five boys, and we all worked in the store."	1242802645000
24000218	24000000	"And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up."	1242802645500
24000219	24000000	"They don't want to hear that \"turn the-other-cheek\" stuff, no."	1242802651500
30000079	30000000	"In addition, we have had extended discussions directed toward that same end with representatives of other governments which have diplomatic relations with North Vietnam."	1242802655500
24000220	24000000	"In Jacksonville, those were teenagers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails."	1242802656500
28000085	28000000	"I worked my way through college, and, to a great extent, through law school."	1242802658000
24000221	24000000	"Negroes have never done that before."	1242802661500
24000222	24000000	"But it shows you there's a new deal coming in."	1242802664500
28000086	28000000	"And then in 1940, probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened."	1242802665000
30000080	30000000	"None of these initiatives have to date produced results."	1242802667500
24000223	24000000	"There's new thinking coming in."	1242802669500

24000225	24000000	"It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month."	1242802674500
28000088	28000000	"We had a rather difficult time after we were married, like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us."	1242802675500
24000226	24000000	"It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets."	1242802682000
30000082	30000000	"I spoke directly in this office, where I'm now sitting, with an individual who had known Ho Chi Minh on a personal basis for 25 years."	1242802683000
24000227	24000000	"It'll be liberty, or it will be death."	1242802685500
28000089	28000000	"I practiced law."	1242802687000

28000091	28000000	"Then, in 1942, I went into the service."	1242802691000
28000092	28000000	"Let me say that my service record was not a particularly unusual one."	1242802695000
24000229	24000000	"You know what is meant by \"reciprocal\"?"	1242802695500

30000084	30000000	"I did this outside of the usual diplomatic channels with the hope that with the necessity of making statements for propaganda removed, there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an end."	1242802701000
28000093	28000000	"I went to the South Pacific."	1242802701500
24000231	24000000	"I stole it from him."	1242802702000
24000232	24000000	"I don't usually deal with those big words because I don't usually deal with big people."	1242802704500
28000094	28000000	"I guess I'm entitled to a couple of battle stars."	1242802704500
28000095	28000000	"I got a couple of letters of commendation."	1242802709500
24000233	24000000	"I deal with small people."	1242802712500
28000096	28000000	"But I was just there when the bombs were falling."	1242802713500
24000234	24000000	"I find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people."	1242802715000
30000085	30000000	"Let me read from that letter to you now:           \"Dear Mr. President:      I realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four years of war. But precisely because of this gulf I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace. I deeply believe that the war in Vietnam has gone on too long and delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one, least of all the people of Vietnam. The time has come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war. You will find us forthcoming and open-minded in a common effort to bring the blessings of peace to the brave people of Vietnam. Let history record that at this critical juncture both sides turned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war.\""	1242802718000
28000097	28000000	"And then I returned -- returned to the United States, and in 1946, I ran for the Congress."	1242802718500
24000235	24000000	"They haven't got anything to lose, and they've got every thing to gain."	1242802726000
28000098	28000000	"When we came out of the war -- Pat and I -- Pat during the war had worked as a stenographer, and in a bank, and as an economist for a Government agency -- and when we came out, the total of our savings, from both my law practice, her teaching and all the time that I was in the war, the total for that entire period was just a little less than 10,000 dollars."	1242802727500
24000236	24000000	"And they'll let you know in a minute: \"It takes two to tango	 when I go, you go.\""	1242802732500
24000237	24000000	"The black nationalists, those whose philosophy is black nationalism, in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights, look upon it as meaning, as Brother Lomax has pointed out, equality of opportunity."	1242802741500
24000238	24000000	"Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to collect for our investment."	1242802759500
28000099	28000000	"Every cent of that, incidentally, was in Government bonds."	1242802765000
28000100	28000000	"Well that's where we start, when I go into politics."	1242802769500
24000239	24000000	"Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood."	1242802772000
28000101	28000000	"Now, what have I earned since I went into politics?"	1242802774500
24000240	24000000	"Three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return -- I mean without a dime in return."	1242802776000
28000102	28000000	"Well, here it is."	1242802779500
28000103	28000000	"I've jotted it down."	1242802781500
28000104	28000000	"Let me read the notes."	1242802783500
28000105	28000000	"First of all, I've had my salary as a Congressman and as a Senator."	1242802786000
24000241	24000000	"You let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick."	1242802787500
28000106	28000000	"Second, I have received a total in this past six years of 1600 dollars from estates which were in my law firm at the time that I severed my connection with it."	1242802793000
30000086	30000000	"I received Ho Chi Minh's reply on August 30, three days before his death."	1242802800000
24000242	24000000	"It got rich because you made it rich."	1242802801000
24000243	24000000	"You take the people who are in this audience right now."	1242802805000
30000087	30000000	"It simply reiterated the public position North Vietnam had taken at Paris and flatly rejected my initiative."	1242802807000
28000107	28000000	"And, incidentally, as I said before, I have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that came into the firm after I went into politics."	1242802809000
24000244	24000000	"They're poor."	1242802810500
24000245	24000000	"We're all poor as individuals."	1242802811500
24000246	24000000	"Our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything."	1242802814000
30000088	30000000	"The full text of both letters is being released to the press."	1242802815500
24000247	24000000	"But if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively, it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets."	1242802818000
30000089	30000000	"In addition to the public meetings that I have referred to, Ambassador Lodge has met with Vietnam's chief negotiator in Paris in 11 private sessions."	1242802821500
28000108	28000000	"I have made an average of approximately 1500 dollars a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures."	1242802825000
24000248	24000000	"It's a lot of wealth."	1242802827500
24000249	24000000	"If you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be rich -- richer than rich."	1242802830000
28000109	28000000	"And then, fortunately, we've inherited a little money."	1242802833500
30000090	30000000	"And we have taken other significant initiatives which must remain secret to keep open some channels of communications which may still prove to be productive."	1242802834000
28000110	28000000	"Pat sold her interest in her father's estate for 3,000 dollars, and I inherited 1500 dollars from my grandfather."	1242802837500
24000250	24000000	"When you look at it like that, think how rich Uncle Sam had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people."	1242802841000
30000091	30000000	"But the effect of all the public, private, and secret negotiations which have been undertaken since the bombing halt a year ago, and since this Administration came into office on January 20th, can be summed up in one sentence: No progress whatever has been made except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table."	1242802846500
28000111	28000000	"We lived rather modestly."	1242802847000
28000112	28000000	"For four years we lived in an apartment in Parkfairfax, in Alexandria, Virginia."	1242802849000
24000251	24000000	"Your and my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from \"can't see\" in the morning until \"can't see\" at night, and worked for nothing, making the white man rich, making Uncle Sam rich."	1242802853000
28000113	28000000	"The rent was 80 dollars a month."	1242802855500
28000114	28000000	"And we saved for the time that we could buy a house."	1242802859000
28000115	28000000	"Now, that was what we took in."	1242802865000
28000116	28000000	"What did we do with this money?"	1242802868500
24000252	24000000	"This is our investment."	1242802872000
28000117	28000000	"What do we have today to show for it?"	1242802872000
30000092	30000000	"Well, now, who's at fault?"	1242802873500
24000253	24000000	"This is our contribution, our blood."	1242802874000
30000093	30000000	"It's become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war is not the President of the United States."	1242802876000
28000118	28000000	"This will surprise you because it is so little, I suppose, as standards generally go of people in public life."	1242802876500
24000254	24000000	"Not only did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood."	1242802877000
24000255	24000000	"Every time he had a call to arms, we were the first ones in uniform."	1242802884000
28000119	28000000	"First of all, we've got a house in Washington, which cost 41,000 dollars and on which we owe 20,000 dollars."	1242802886500
30000094	30000000	"It is not the South Vietnamese Government."	1242802886500
30000095	30000000	"The obstacle is the other side's absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join us in seeking a just peace."	1242802890000
24000256	24000000	"We died on every battlefield the white man had."	1242802891500
24000257	24000000	"We have made a greater sacrifice than anybody who's standing up in America today."	1242802896000
28000120	28000000	"We have a house in Whittier, California which cost 13,000 dollars and on which we owe 3000 dollars."	1242802896500
30000096	30000000	"And it will not do so while it is convinced that all it has to do is to wait for our next concession, and our next concession after that one, until it gets everything it wants."	1242802900500
24000258	24000000	"We have made a greater contribution and have collected less."	1242802903000
28000121	28000000	"My folks are living there at the present time."	1242802905500
24000259	24000000	"Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, means: \"Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give it to us yesterday, and that's not fast enough.\""	1242802908000
28000122	28000000	"I have just 4000 dollars in life insurance, plus my GI policy which I've never been able to convert, and which will run out in two years."	1242802910000
30000097	30000000	"There can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depends only on Hanoi 's deciding to negotiate -- to negotiate seriously."	1242802918500
28000123	28000000	"I have no life insurance whatever on Pat."	1242802923500
24000260	24000000	"I might stop right here to point out one thing."	1242802924000
28000124	28000000	"I have no life insurance on our two youngsters, Tricia and Julie."	1242802927500
24000261	24000000	"Whenever you're going after something that belongs to you, anyone who's depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal."	1242802929000
30000098	30000000	"I realize that this report on our efforts on the diplomatic front is discouraging to the American people, but the American people are entitled to know the truth -- the bad news as well as the good news -- where the lives of our young men are involved."	1242802930500
28000125	28000000	"I own a 1950 Oldsmobile car."	1242802933500
28000126	28000000	"We have our furniture."	1242802936500
28000127	28000000	"We have no stocks and bonds of any type."	1242802938500
24000262	24000000	"Understand that."	1242802940000
24000263	24000000	"Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it."	1242802941000
28000128	28000000	"We have no interest of any kind, direct or indirect, in any business."	1242802943000
28000129	28000000	"Now, that's what we have."	1242802949500
24000264	24000000	"And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal."	1242802951000
28000130	28000000	"What do we owe?"	1242802952000
28000131	28000000	"Well in addition to the mortgage, the 20,000 dollar mortgage on the house in Washington, the 10,000 dollar one on the house in Whittier, I owe 4500 dollars to the Riggs Bank in Washington, D."	1242802954000
30000099	30000000	"Now let me turn, however, to a more encouraging report on another front."	1242802954500
30000100	30000000	"At the time we launched our search for peace, I recognized we might not succeed in bringing an end to the war through negotiations."	1242802961000
24000265	24000000	"And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision."	1242802962000
24000266	24000000	"It outlawed segregation."	1242802967000
24000267	24000000	"Which means segregation is against the law."	1242802968500
28000132	28000000	"C."	1242802971500
24000268	24000000	"Which means a segregationist is breaking the law."	1242802972000
28000133	28000000	"with interest 4 and 1/2 percent."	1242802972000
30000101	30000000	"I therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace -- a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on the negotiating front."	1242802973000
28000134	28000000	"I owe 3500 dollars to my parents, and the interest on that loan, which I pay regularly, because it's the part of the savings they made through the years they were working so hard -- I pay regularly 4 percent interest."	1242802975000
24000269	24000000	"A segregationist is a criminal."	1242802976000
24000270	24000000	"You can't label him as anything other than that."	1242802978500
24000271	24000000	"And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side."	1242802983000
30000102	30000000	"It is in line with the major shift in U."	1242802987500
24000272	24000000	"The Supreme Court is on your side."	1242802989000
24000273	24000000	"Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law?"	1242802992500
30000103	30000000	"S."	1242802992500
30000104	30000000	"foreign policy which I described in my press conference at Guam on July 25."	1242802993000
28000135	28000000	"And then I have a 500 dollar loan, which I have on my life insurance."	1242802995500
24000274	24000000	"The police department itself."	1242802998500
30000105	30000000	"Let me briefly explain what has been described as the Nixon Doctrine -- a policy which not only will help end the war in Vietnam but which is an essential element of our program to prevent future Vietnams."	1242803000000
24000275	24000000	"With police dogs and clubs."	1242803000500
24000276	24000000	"Whenever you demonstrate against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer."	1242803003000
28000136	28000000	"Well, that's about it."	1242803003000
28000137	28000000	"That's what we have."	1242803005000
28000138	28000000	"And that's what we owe."	1242803007000
28000139	28000000	"It isn't very much."	1242803009500
28000140	28000000	"But Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we've got is honestly ours."	1242803011500
30000106	30000000	"We Americans are a do-it-yourself people -- we're an impatient people."	1242803019000
28000141	28000000	"I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat."	1242803019500
24000277	24000000	"They are breaking the law	 they are not representatives of the law."	1242803020000
30000107	30000000	"Instead of teaching someone else to do a job, we like to do it ourselves."	1242803024500
28000142	28000000	"But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she'd look good in anything."	1242803025000
24000278	24000000	"Any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill him, I'm telling you, kill that dog."	1242803026000
30000108	30000000	"And this trait has been carried over into our foreign policy."	1242803032000
28000143	28000000	"One other thing I probably should tell you, because if I don't they'll probably be saying this about me, too."	1242803034500
30000109	30000000	"In Korea, and again in Vietnam, the United States furnished most of the money, most of the arms, and most of the men to help the people of those countries defend their freedom against Communist aggression."	1242803037500
24000279	24000000	"I say it, if they put me in jail tomorrow, kill that dog."	1242803041000
28000144	28000000	"We did get something, a gift, after the election."	1242803044500
24000280	24000000	"Then you'll put a stop to it."	1242803047500
28000145	28000000	"A man down in Texas heard Pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog."	1242803049000
24000281	24000000	"Now, if these white people in here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in."	1242803051000
30000110	30000000	"Before any American troops were committed to Vietnam, a leader of another Asian country expressed this opinion to me when I was traveling in Asia as a private citizen."	1242803055500
28000146	28000000	"And believe it or not, the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from Union Station in Baltimore, saying they had a package for us."	1242803060500
24000282	24000000	"That's all you have to do."	1242803066500
24000283	24000000	"If you don't do it, someone else will."	1242803069500
30000111	30000000	"He said: \"When you are trying to assist another nation defend its freedom, U.S. policy should be to help them fight the war, but not to fight the war for them.\""	1242803070000
24000284	24000000	"If you don't take this kind of stand, your little children will grow up and look at you and think \"shame.\""	1242803073500
28000147	28000000	"We went down to get it."	1242803075500
28000148	28000000	"You know what it was?"	1242803078500
28000149	28000000	"It was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he'd sent all the way from Texas, black and white, spotted."	1242803081000
24000285	24000000	"If you don't take an uncompromising stand, I don't mean go out and get violent	 but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence."	1242803084000
30000112	30000000	"Well in accordance with this wise counsel, I laid down in Guam three principles as guidelines for future American policy toward Asia."	1242803085500
28000150	28000000	"And our little girl Tricia, the six year old, named it \"Checkers.\""	1242803092000
30000113	30000000	"First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments."	1242803096500
28000151	28000000	"And you know, the kids, like all kids, love the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it."	1242803098000
24000286	24000000	"I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me."	1242803099500
30000114	30000000	"Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us, or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security."	1242803102000
24000287	24000000	"But when you drop that violence on me, then you've made me go insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do."	1242803104000
28000152	28000000	"It isn't easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life, as I've done."	1242803114000
24000288	24000000	"And that's the way every Negro should get."	1242803115000
30000115	30000000	"Third, in cases involving other types of aggression we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments."	1242803117500
24000289	24000000	"Any time you know you're within the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with justice, then die for what you believe in."	1242803119000
28000153	28000000	"But I want to say some things before I conclude that I think most of you will agree on."	1242803122000
30000116	30000000	"But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense."	1242803129000
28000154	28000000	"Mr."	1242803131500
28000155	28000000	"Mitchell, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made this statement -- that if a man couldn't afford to be in the United States Senate, he shouldn't run for the Senate."	1242803132000
24000290	24000000	"But don't die alone."	1242803132500
24000291	24000000	"Let your dying be reciprocal."	1242803134500
24000292	24000000	"This is what is meant by equality."	1242803137000
30000117	30000000	"After I announced this policy, I found that the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, other nations which might be threatened by Communist aggression, welcomed this new direction in American foreign policy."	1242803139500
24000293	24000000	"What's good for the goose is good for the gander."	1242803140500
24000294	24000000	"When we begin to get in this area, we need new friends, we need new allies."	1242803145500
28000156	28000000	"And I just want to make my position clear."	1242803147500
28000157	28000000	"I don't agree with Mr."	1242803152000
24000295	24000000	"We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level -- to the level of human rights."	1242803153500
28000158	28000000	"Mitchell when he says that only a rich man should serve his Government in the United States Senate or in the Congress."	1242803154500
30000118	30000000	"The defense of freedom is everybody's business -- not just America's business."	1242803156500
24000296	24000000	"Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle, whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam."	1242803162500
30000119	30000000	"And it is particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is threatened."	1242803162500
28000159	28000000	"I don't believe that represents the thinking of the Democratic Party, and I know that it doesn't represent the thinking of the Republican Party."	1242803165500
30000120	30000000	"In the previous Administration, we Americanized the war in Vietnam."	1242803169000
24000297	24000000	"No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle."	1242803174000
30000121	30000000	"In this Administration, we are Vietnamizing the search for peace."	1242803174000
28000160	28000000	"I believe that it's fine that a man like Governor Stevenson, who inherited a fortune from his father, can run for President."	1242803177500
30000122	30000000	"The policy of the previous Administration not only resulted in our assuming the primary responsibility for fighting the war, but even more significant did not adequately stress the goal of strengthening the South Vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left."	1242803179000
24000298	24000000	"Civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country."	1242803184500
28000161	28000000	"But I also feel that it's essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can also run for President, because, you know, remember Abraham Lincoln, you remember what he said: \"God must have loved the common people -- he made so many of them.\""	1242803188500
24000299	24000000	"All of our African brothers and our Asian brothers and our Latin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States."	1242803189500
30000123	30000000	"The Vietnamization plan was launched following Secretary Laird's visit to Vietnam in March."	1242803200500
24000300	24000000	"And as long as it's civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam."	1242803203000
30000124	30000000	"Under the plan, I ordered first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of South Vietnamese forces."	1242803207000
24000301	24000000	"But the United Nations has what's known as the charter of human rights	 it has a committee that deals in human rights."	1242803210500
28000162	28000000	"And now I'm going to suggest some courses of conduct."	1242803212500
30000125	30000000	"In July, on my visit to Vietnam, I changed General Abrams's orders, so that they were consistent with the objectives of our new policies."	1242803216000
28000163	28000000	"First of all, you have read in the papers about other funds, now."	1242803217500
24000302	24000000	"You may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia, and in Latin America are brought before the UN, and the Negro problem is never brought before the UN."	1242803221500
28000164	28000000	"Mr."	1242803224000
28000165	28000000	"Stevenson apparently had a couple -- one of them in which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of State employees."	1242803224500
30000126	30000000	"Under the new orders, the primary mission of our troops is to enable the South Vietnamese forces to assume the full responsibility for the security of South Vietnam."	1242803228000
28000166	28000000	"Here is where the money went directly into their pockets, and I think that what Mr."	1242803237500
24000303	24000000	"This is part of the conspiracy."	1242803241000
30000127	30000000	"Our air operations have been reduced by over 20 per cent."	1242803242000
24000304	24000000	"This old, tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser, never tells you anything about human rights."	1242803244000
28000167	28000000	"Stevenson should do should be to come before the American people, as I have, give the names of the people that contributed to that fund, give the names of the people who put this money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their State government and see what favors, if any, they gave out for that."	1242803245500
30000128	30000000	"And now we have begun to see the results of this long-overdue change in American policy in Vietnam."	1242803247500
30000129	30000000	"After five years of Americans going into Vietnam we are finally bringing American men home."	1242803256500
30000130	30000000	"By December 15 over 60,000 men will have been withdrawn from South Vietnam, including 20 percent of all of our combat forces."	1242803264000
24000305	24000000	"They keep you wrapped up in civil rights."	1242803266500
24000306	24000000	"And you spend so much time barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a human-rights tree on the same floor."	1242803270500
30000131	30000000	"The South Vietnamese have continued to gain in strength."	1242803275000
28000168	28000000	"I don't condemn Mr."	1242803276500
28000169	28000000	"Stevenson for what he did, but until the facts are in there is a doubt that will be raised."	1242803278500
30000132	30000000	"As a result, they've been able to take over combat responsibilities from our American troops."	1242803279500
24000307	24000000	"When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the UN."	1242803282000
30000133	30000000	"Two other significant developments have occurred since this Administration took office."	1242803287000
28000170	28000000	"And as far as Mr."	1242803288000
28000171	28000000	"Sparkman is concerned, I would suggest the same thing."	1242803290500
30000134	30000000	"Enemy infiltration, infiltration which is essential if they are to launch a major attack over the last three months, is less than 20 percent of what it was over the same period last year."	1242803292500
28000172	28000000	"He's had his wife on the payroll."	1242803295000
24000308	24000000	"You can take it before the General Assembly."	1242803297500
28000173	28000000	"I don't condemn him for that, but I think that he should come before the American people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had."	1242803298500
24000309	24000000	"You can take Uncle Sam before a world court."	1242803301500
24000310	24000000	"But the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights."	1242803306000
30000135	30000000	"And most important, United States casualties have declined during the last two months to the lowest point in three years."	1242803309500
28000174	28000000	"I would suggest that under the circumstances both Mr."	1242803312000
24000311	24000000	"Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under his jurisdiction."	1242803313500
28000175	28000000	"Sparkman and Mr."	1242803316500
28000176	28000000	"Stevenson should come before the American people, as I have, and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history, and if they don't it will be an admission that they have something to hide."	1242803318000
24000312	24000000	"Civil rights keeps you in his pocket."	1242803318500
30000136	30000000	"Let me now turn to our program for the future."	1242803319500
24000313	24000000	"Civil rights means you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right."	1242803322000
30000137	30000000	"We have adopted a plan which we have worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all U."	1242803324500
24000314	24000000	"Human rights are something you were born with."	1242803327500
24000315	24000000	"Human rights are your God-given rights."	1242803331500
24000316	24000000	"Human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth."	1242803334500
28000177	28000000	"And I think you will agree with me -- because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States, must have the confidence of all the people."	1242803336000
30000138	30000000	"S."	1242803336000
30000139	30000000	"combat ground forces and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces on an orderly scheduled timetable."	1242803336500
24000317	24000000	"And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court."	1242803341500
30000140	30000000	"This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness."	1242803344000
30000141	30000000	"As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of American withdrawal can become greater."	1242803349500
24000318	24000000	"Uncle Sam's hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black man in this country."	1242803350000
28000178	28000000	"And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing."	1242803356500
30000142	30000000	"I have not, and do not, intend to announce the timetable for our program, and there are obvious reasons for this decision which I'm sure you will understand."	1242803356500
24000319	24000000	"He's the earth's number-one hypocrite."	1242803359000
28000179	28000000	"And that's why I suggest that Mr."	1242803360500
24000320	24000000	"He has the audacity -- yes, he has -- imagine him posing as the leader of the free world."	1242803361500
28000180	28000000	"Stevenson and Mr."	1242803364000
28000181	28000000	"Sparkman, since they are under attack, should do what they're doing."	1242803365500
30000143	30000000	"As I've indicated on several occasions, the rate of withdrawal will depend on developments on three fronts."	1242803370500
24000321	24000000	"The free world!"	1242803371000
28000182	28000000	"Now let me say this: I know that this is not the last of the smears."	1242803371000
24000322	24000000	"And you over here singing \"We Shall Overcome.\""	1242803372500
24000323	24000000	"Expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights."	1242803376500
28000183	28000000	"In spite of my explanation tonight, other smears will be made."	1242803379000
30000144	30000000	"One of these is the progress which can be, or might be, made in the Paris talks."	1242803379000
24000324	24000000	"Take it into the United Nations, where our African brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side, and where 800 million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side."	1242803381500
28000184	28000000	"Others have been made in the past."	1242803384500
30000145	30000000	"An announcement of a fixed timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement."	1242803387500
28000185	28000000	"And the purpose of the smears, I know, is this: to silence me	 to make me let up."	1242803388000
28000186	28000000	"Well, they just don't know who they're dealing with."	1242803397000
30000146	30000000	"They would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and then move in."	1242803398000
28000187	28000000	"I'm going to tell you this: I remember in the dark days of the Hiss case some of the same columnists, some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position, were violently opposing me at the time I was after Alger Hiss."	1242803401500
30000147	30000000	"The other two factors on which we will base our withdrawal decisions are the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training programs of the South Vietnamese forces."	1242803404500
24000325	24000000	"Let the world know how bloody his hands are."	1242803409000
24000326	24000000	"Let the world know the hypocrisy that's practiced over here."	1242803413500
24000327	24000000	"Let it be the ballot or the bullet."	1242803418500
30000148	30000000	"And I am glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these fronts has been greater than we anticipated when we started the program in June for withdrawal."	1242803419500
24000328	24000000	"Let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet."	1242803422500
28000188	28000000	"But I continued to fight because I knew I was right, and I can say to this great television and radio audience that I have no apologies to the American people for my part in putting Alger Hiss where he is today."	1242803425500
24000329	24000000	"When you take your case to Washington, D."	1242803428500
24000330	24000000	"C."	1242803432500
24000331	24000000	"you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible	 it's like running from the wolf to the fox."	1242803433000
30000149	30000000	"As a result, our timetable for withdrawal is more optimistic now than when we made our first estimates in June."	1242803435000
24000332	24000000	"They're all in cahoots together."	1242803441500
24000333	24000000	"They all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world."	1242803444000
30000150	30000000	"Now this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen in on a fixed timetable."	1242803445000
28000189	28000000	"And as far as this is concerned, I intend to continue to fight."	1242803446500
24000334	24000000	"Here you are walking around in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek."	1242803453000
28000190	28000000	"Why do I feel so deeply?"	1242803453000
30000151	30000000	"We must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it is at that time, rather than on estimates that are no longer valid."	1242803453500
28000191	28000000	"Why do I feel that in spite of the smears, the misunderstanding, the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as I have -- why is it necessary for me to continue this fight?"	1242803456000
30000152	30000000	"Along with this optimistic estimate, I must in all candor leave one note of caution."	1242803467500
24000335	24000000	"No, take Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world."	1242803474500
30000153	30000000	"If the level of enemy activity significantly increases, we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly."	1242803475000
28000192	28000000	"And I want to tell you why."	1242803475500
28000193	28000000	"Because, you see, I love my country."	1242803479000
24000336	24000000	"By ballot I only mean freedom."	1242803480000
28000194	28000000	"And I think my country is in danger."	1242803482500
24000337	24000000	"Don't you know -- I disagree with Lomax on this issue -- that the ballot is more important than the dollar?"	1242803483000
30000154	30000000	"However, I want the record to be completely clear on one point."	1242803483000
28000195	28000000	"And I think the only man that can save America at this time is the man that's running for President, on my ticket -- Dwight Eisenhower."	1242803486500
30000155	30000000	"At the time of the bombing halt just a year ago there was some confusion as to whether there was an understanding on the part of the enemy that if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam, they would stop the shelling of cities in South Vietnam."	1242803489000
24000338	24000000	"Can I prove it?"	1242803493500
24000339	24000000	"Yes."	1242803495500
24000340	24000000	"Look in the UN."	1242803496000
24000341	24000000	"There are poor nations in the UN	 yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move."	1242803498000
28000196	28000000	"You say, \"Why do I think it is in danger?\""	1242803499500
28000197	28000000	"And I say, look at the record."	1242803504500
28000198	28000000	"Seven years of the Truman-Acheson Administration, and what's happened?"	1242803508000
24000342	24000000	"They have one nation -- one vote, everyone has an equal vote."	1242803511500
28000199	28000000	"Six hundred million people lost to the Communists."	1242803512500
30000156	30000000	"I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program."	1242803512500
28000200	28000000	"And a war in Korea in which we have lost 117,000 American casualties, and I say to all of you that a policy that results in the loss of 600 million people to the Communists, and a war which cost us 117,000 American casualties isn't good enough for America."	1242803516500
24000343	24000000	"And when those brothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold Sam in check."	1242803517500
30000157	30000000	"We have noted the reduced level of infiltration, the reduction of our casualties and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially on those factors."	1242803523500
24000344	24000000	"Or Russia in check."	1242803531000
24000345	24000000	"Or some other section of the earth in check."	1242803533000
30000158	30000000	"If the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting, it will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy."	1242803535000
24000346	24000000	"So, the ballot is most important."	1242803537500
24000347	24000000	"Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans -- that's what we are -- Africans who are in America."	1242803540500
28000201	28000000	"And I say that those in the State Department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the State Department just as fast as we get them out of there."	1242803541000
30000159	30000000	"Hanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage."	1242803550000
24000348	24000000	"You're nothing but Africans."	1242803552000
24000349	24000000	"Nothing but Africans."	1242803554000
24000350	24000000	"In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself African instead of Negro."	1242803555500
30000160	30000000	"If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam, I shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation."	1242803559500
24000351	24000000	"Africans don't catch hell."	1242803561000
28000202	28000000	"And let me say that I know Mr."	1242803561500
24000352	24000000	"You're the only one catching hell."	1242803563000
28000203	28000000	"Stevenson won't do that because he defends the Truman policy, and I know that Dwight Eisenhower will do that, and that he will give America the leadership that it needs."	1242803565500
24000353	24000000	"They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans."	1242803566000
24000354	24000000	"An African can go anywhere he wants right now."	1242803570500
30000161	30000000	"This is not a threat."	1242803573500
24000355	24000000	"All you've got to do is tie your head up."	1242803575000
30000162	30000000	"This is a statement of policy which as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces I am making and meeting my responsibility for the protection of American fighting men wherever they may be."	1242803576000
24000356	24000000	"That's right, go anywhere you want."	1242803580000
28000204	28000000	"Take the problem of corruption."	1242803580500
24000357	24000000	"Just stop being a Negro."	1242803583000
28000205	28000000	"You've read about the mess in Washington."	1242803583000
24000358	24000000	"Change your name to Hoogagagooba."	1242803585500
28000206	28000000	"Mr."	1242803586500
28000207	28000000	"Stevenson can't clean it up because he was picked by the man, Truman, under whose Administration the mess was made."	1242803587000
24000359	24000000	"That'll show you how silly the white man is."	1242803588000
30000163	30000000	"My fellow Americans, I am sure you can recognize from what I have said that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to end this war."	1242803591500
24000360	24000000	"You're dealing with a silly man."	1242803592500
24000361	24000000	"A friend of mine who's very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called themselves desegregated."	1242803595500
28000208	28000000	"You wouldn't trust the man who made the mess to clean it up."	1242803597000
28000209	28000000	"That's Truman."	1242803603500
28000210	28000000	"And by the same token you can't trust the man who was picked by the man that made the mess to clean it up -- and that's Stevenson."	1242803604500
30000164	30000000	"I can order an immediate precipitate withdrawal of all Americans from Vietnam without regard to the effects of that action."	1242803607000
24000362	24000000	"He went into a white restaurant, he sat down, they served him, and he said, \"What would happen if a Negro came in here? And there he's sitting, black as night, but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says, \"Why, there wouldn't no nigger dare come in here."	1242803608000
30000165	30000000	"Or we can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement, if possible, or through continued implementation of our plan for Vietnamization, if necessary -- a plan in which we will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom."	1242803617000
28000211	28000000	"And so I say, Eisenhower, who owed nothing to Truman, nothing to the big city bosses -- he is the man that can clean up the mess in Washington."	1242803618500
28000212	28000000	"Take Communism."	1242803633000
28000213	28000000	"I say that as far as that subject is concerned the danger is great to America."	1242803634000
24000363	24000000	"So, you're dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind, his intelligence, every day."	1242803636000
28000214	28000000	"In the Hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the American secret State Department code."	1242803642000
24000364	24000000	"He's frightened."	1242803646000
24000365	24000000	"He looks around and sees what's taking place on this earth, and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction."	1242803647000
30000166	30000000	"I have chosen this second course."	1242803648000
30000167	30000000	"It is not the easy way."	1242803651000
28000215	28000000	"They got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years before they would have gotten it by their own devices."	1242803651500
30000168	30000000	"It is the right way."	1242803654000
30000169	30000000	"It is a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace, not just in Vietnam but in the Pacific and in the world."	1242803656500
24000366	24000000	"The dark people are waking up."	1242803659000
24000367	24000000	"They're losing their fear of the white man."	1242803662000
24000368	24000000	"No place where he's fighting right now is he winning."	1242803666000
28000216	28000000	"And I say that any man who called the Alger Hiss case a red herring isn't fit to be President of the United States."	1242803667000
30000170	30000000	"In speaking of the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, I mentioned that our allies would lose confidence in America."	1242803670000
24000369	24000000	"Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my complexion."	1242803671000
24000370	24000000	"And they're beating him."	1242803676000
24000371	24000000	"He can't win any more."	1242803678000
28000217	28000000	"I say that a man who, like Mr."	1242803679000
30000171	30000000	"Far more dangerous, we would lose confidence in ourselves."	1242803679500
24000372	24000000	"He's won his last battle."	1242803680500
24000373	24000000	"He failed to win the Korean War."	1242803683000
28000218	28000000	"Stevenson, has pooh-poohed and ridiculed the Communist threat in the United States -- he said that they are phantoms among ourselves."	1242803683000
30000172	30000000	"Oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our men were coming home."	1242803684000
24000374	24000000	"He couldn't win it."	1242803686500
24000375	24000000	"He had to sign a truce."	1242803688500
24000376	24000000	"That's a loss."	1242803691500
30000173	30000000	"But as we saw the consequences of what we had done, inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people."	1242803692000
24000377	24000000	"Any time Uncle Sam, with all his machinery for warfare, is held to a draw by some rice eaters, he's lost the battle."	1242803693000
28000219	28000000	"He has accused us that have attempted to expose the Communists, of looking for Communists in the Bureau of Fisheries and Wildlife."	1242803693500
30000174	30000000	"We have faced other crises in our history and we have become stronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking the right way in meeting our challenges."	1242803703500
24000378	24000000	"He had to sign a truce."	1242803704500
28000220	28000000	"I say that a man who says that isn't qualified to be President of the United States."	1242803704500
24000379	24000000	"America's not supposed to sign a truce."	1242803707500
24000380	24000000	"She's supposed to be bad."	1242803711000
28000221	28000000	"And I say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the Government of both those who are Communists and those who have corrupted this Government is Eisenhower, because Eisenhower, you can be sure, recognizes the problem, and he knows how to deal with it."	1242803713000
24000381	24000000	"But she's not bad any more."	1242803713500
24000382	24000000	"She's bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fear Russia might use hers."	1242803716500
30000175	30000000	"Our greatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what has to be done when we knew our course was right."	1242803717500
24000383	24000000	"Russia can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his."	1242803727500
30000176	30000000	"I recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen."	1242803729000
24000384	24000000	"So, both of them are weapon-less."	1242803733000
24000385	24000000	"They can't use the weapon because each's weapon nullifies the other's."	1242803736000
30000177	30000000	"Honest and patriotic Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved."	1242803737500
28000222	28000000	"Now let me that finally, this evening, I want to read to you, just briefly, excerpts from a letter which I received, a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us."	1242803738000
24000386	24000000	"So the only place where action can take place is on the ground."	1242803741500
30000178	30000000	"In San Francisco a few weeks ago, I saw demonstrators carrying signs reading, \"Lose in Vietnam, bring the boys home.\""	1242803745000
24000387	24000000	"And the white man can't win another war fighting on the ground."	1242803748000
24000388	24000000	"Those days are over The black man knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and the yellow man knows it."	1242803754000
30000179	30000000	"Well, one of the strengths of our free society is that any American has a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view."	1242803755000
28000223	28000000	"It reads as follows:      Dear Senator Nixon,      Since I am only 19 years of age, I can't vote in this presidential election, but believe me if I could you and General Eisenhower would certainly get my vote."	1242803756500
24000389	24000000	"So they engage him in guerrilla warfare."	1242803766500
30000180	30000000	"But as President of the United States, I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this nation to be dictated by the minority who hold that point of view and who try to impose it on the nation by mounting demonstrations in the street."	1242803768500
24000390	24000000	"That's not his style."	1242803770000
24000391	24000000	"You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he hasn't got any heart."	1242803772000
24000392	24000000	"I'm telling you now."	1242803780000
28000224	28000000	"My husband is in the Fleet Marines in Korea."	1242803780000
24000393	24000000	"I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because, before you know it, before you know it."	1242803782000
28000225	28000000	"He' a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son he's never seen."	1242803784500
24000394	24000000	"It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you're on your own."	1242803792500
28000226	28000000	"And I feel confident that with great Americans like you and General Eisenhower in the White House, lonely Americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in Korea."	1242803793500
30000181	30000000	"For almost 200 years, the policy of this nation has been made under our Constitution by those leaders in the Congress and the White House elected by all the people."	1242803794000
24000395	24000000	"In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up -- planes over your head and all that kind of stuff."	1242803799000
28000227	28000000	"I only pray to God that you won't be too late."	1242803809000
30000182	30000000	"If a vocal minority, however fervent its cause, prevails over reason and the will of the majority, this nation has no future as a free society."	1242803809000
24000396	24000000	"But a guerrilla is on his own."	1242803814000
28000228	28000000	"Enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign."	1242803814500
24000397	24000000	"All you have is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need -- and a lot of heart."	1242803817500
28000229	28000000	"Living on $85 a month, it is all I can afford at present, but let me know what else I can do."	1242803820000
30000183	30000000	"And now, I would like to address a word, if I may, to the young people of this nation who are particularly concerned, and I understand why they are concerned, about this war."	1242803822000
24000398	24000000	"The Japanese on some of those islands in the Pacific, when the American soldiers landed, one Japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off."	1242803829500
28000230	28000000	"Folks, it's a check for 10 dollars, and it's one that I will never cash."	1242803831000
28000231	28000000	"And just let me say this: We hear a lot about prosperity these days, but I say why can't we have prosperity built on peace, rather than prosperity built on war?"	1242803838500
30000184	30000000	"I respect your idealism."	1242803838500
30000185	30000000	"I share your concern for peace."	1242803840500
24000399	24000000	"He'd just wait until the sun went down, and when the sun went down they were all equal."	1242803841500
30000186	30000000	"I want peace as much as you do."	1242803843500
30000187	30000000	"There are powerful personal reasons I want to end this war."	1242803847500
24000400	24000000	"He would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush, and from American to American."	1242803850500
30000188	30000000	"This week I will have to sign 83 letters to mothers, fathers, wives, and loved ones of men who have given their lives for America in Vietnam."	1242803853000
28000232	28000000	"Why can't we have prosperity and an honest Government in Washington, D."	1242803854000
24000401	24000000	"The white soldiers couldn't cope with that."	1242803859000
28000233	28000000	"C."	1242803860000
28000234	28000000	"at the same time?"	1242803860500
24000402	24000000	"Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death."	1242803862500
28000235	28000000	"Believe me, we can."	1242803862500
28000236	28000000	"And Eisenhower is the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity."	1242803864500
30000189	30000000	"It's very little satisfaction to me that this is only one-third as many letters as I signed the first week in office."	1242803866500
28000237	28000000	"And now, finally, I know that you wonder whether or not I am going to stay on the Republican ticket or resign."	1242803873000
24000403	24000000	"The same thing happened to the French up in French Indochina."	1242803875500
30000190	30000000	"There is nothing I want more than to see the day come when I do not have to write any of those letters."	1242803877500
24000404	24000000	"People who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavily-mechanized French army out of Indochina."	1242803881000
28000238	28000000	"Let me say this: I don't believe that I ought to quit, because I am not a quitter."	1242803884000
30000191	30000000	"I want to end the war to save the lives of those brave young men in Vietnam."	1242803889000
24000405	24000000	"You don't need it -- modern warfare today won't work."	1242803891500
28000239	28000000	"And, incidentally, Pat's not a quitter."	1242803893000
28000240	28000000	"After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St."	1242803896000
24000406	24000000	"This is the day of the guerrilla."	1242803896500
30000192	30000000	"But I want to end it in a way which will increase the chance that their younger brothers and their sons will not have to fight in some future Vietnam some place in the world."	1242803897500
24000407	24000000	"They did the same thing in Algeria."	1242803900000
28000241	28000000	"Patrick's day, and you know the Irish never quit."	1242803902500
24000408	24000000	"Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a rine and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his highfalutin' war machinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas."	1242803903500
28000242	28000000	"But the decision, my friends, is not mine."	1242803907000
28000243	28000000	"I would do nothing that would harm the possibilities of Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States."	1242803911000
30000193	30000000	"And I want to end the war for another reason."	1242803915000
24000409	24000000	"Nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare."	1242803918000
30000194	30000000	"I want to end it so that the energy and dedication of you, our young people, now too often directed into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war, can be turned to the great challenges of peace, a better life for all Americans, a better life for all people on this earth."	1242803920000
28000244	28000000	"And for that reason I am submitting to the Republican National Committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make."	1242803920500
24000410	24000000	"It's not his speed."	1242803924500
24000411	24000000	"Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in Asia and in parts of Africa and in parts of Latin America, you've got to be mighty naive, or you've got to play the black man cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet."	1242803926500
28000245	28000000	"Let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt."	1242803933000
28000246	28000000	"And I am going to ask you to help them decide."	1242803939500
28000247	28000000	"Wire and write the Republican National Committee whether you think I should stay on or whether I should get off."	1242803945000
30000195	30000000	"I have chosen a plan for peace."	1242803946500
30000196	30000000	"I believe it will succeed."	1242803950000
30000197	30000000	"If it does not succeed, what the critics say now won't matter."	1242803952500
24000412	24000000	"l would like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Muslim Mosque, Inc."	1242803955000
28000248	28000000	"And whatever their decision is, I will abide by it."	1242803955000
30000198	30000000	"Or if it does succeed, what the critics say now won't matter."	1242803958500
28000249	28000000	"But just let me say this last word: Regardless of what happens, I'm going to continue this fight."	1242803960000
24000413	24000000	"which we established recently in New York City."	1242803962500
30000199	30000000	"If it does not succeed, anything I say then won't matter."	1242803964500
24000414	24000000	"It's true we're Muslims and our religion is Islam, but we don't mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities -- not any more We keep our religion in our mosque."	1242803966500
28000250	28000000	"I'm going to campaign up and down in America until we drive the crooks and the Communists and those that defend them out of Washington."	1242803969000
30000200	30000000	"I know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days, but I feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion."	1242803970000
28000251	28000000	"And remember folks, Eisenhower is a great man, believe me."	1242803981500
30000201	30000000	"Two hundred years ago this nation was weak and poor."	1242803984000
24000415	24000000	"After our religious services are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic action and social and civic action."	1242803985500
28000252	28000000	"He's a great man."	1242803986500
28000253	28000000	"And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what's good for America."	1242803988500
30000202	30000000	"But even then, America was the hope of millions in the world."	1242803989000
28000254	28000000	"And what's good for America."	1242803995000
30000203	30000000	"Today we have become the strongest and richest nation in the world, and the wheel of destiny has turned so that any hope the world has for the survival of peace and freedom will be determined by whether the American people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge of free-world leadership."	1242803995000
24000416	24000000	"We become involved with anybody, any where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils, the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community."	1242803996500
24000417	24000000	"The political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community	 no more."	1242804013000
30000204	30000000	"Let historians not record that, when America was the most powerful nation in the world, we passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the forces of totalitarianism."	1242804022500
24000418	24000000	"The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return."	1242804025000
24000419	24000000	"Don't be throwing out any ballots."	1242804039500
24000420	24000000	"A ballot is like a bullet."	1242804042500
30000205	30000000	"So tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans, I ask for your support."	1242804045000
24000421	24000000	"You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket."	1242804045500
30000206	30000000	"I pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace."	1242804053500
24000422	24000000	"The political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the Christian church."	1242804058000
30000207	30000000	"I have initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keep that pledge."	1242804064000
24000423	24000000	"It's being taught in the NAACP."	1242804064500
24000424	24000000	"It's being taught in CORE meetings."	1242804067500
24000425	24000000	"It's being taught in SNCC Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee meetings."	1242804070500
30000208	30000000	"The more support I can have from the American people, the sooner that pledge can be redeemed."	1242804071500
24000426	24000000	"It's being taught in Muslim meetings."	1242804075500
24000427	24000000	"It's being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together."	1242804078500
30000209	30000000	"For the more divided we are at home, the less likely the enemy is to negotiate at Paris."	1242804080000
24000428	24000000	"It's being taught everywhere."	1242804084000
24000429	24000000	"Black people are fed up with the dillydallying, pussyfooting, compromising approach that we've been using toward getting our freedom."	1242804086000
30000210	30000000	"Let us be united for peace."	1242804089000
30000211	30000000	"Let us also be united against defeat."	1242804092000
24000430	24000000	"We want freedom now, but we're not going to get it saying \"We Shall Overcome.\""	1242804095500
30000212	30000000	"Because let us understand -- North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States."	1242804095500
30000213	30000000	"Only Americans can do that."	1242804102500
24000431	24000000	"We've got to fight until we overcome."	1242804103000
30000214	30000000	"Fifty years ago, in this room, and at this very desk, President Woodrow Wilson spoke words which caught the imagination of a war-weary world."	1242804105000
24000432	24000000	"The economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple."	1242804106500
24000433	24000000	"It only means that we should control the economy of our community."	1242804111500
30000215	30000000	"He said: \"This is the war to end wars.\""	1242804117000
24000434	24000000	"Why should white people be running all the stores in our community?"	1242804117500
30000216	30000000	"His dream for peace after World War I was shattered on the hard reality of great power politics."	1242804121500
24000435	24000000	"Why should white people be running the banks of our community?"	1242804123500
24000436	24000000	"Why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man?"	1242804129000
30000217	30000000	"And Woodrow Wilson died a broken man."	1242804130500
30000218	30000000	"Tonight, I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars, but I do say this: I have initiated a plan which will end this war in a way that will bring us closer to that great goal to which -- to which Woodrow Wilson and every American President in our history has been dedicated -- the goal of a just and lasting peace."	1242804134000
24000437	24000000	"Why?"	1242804136500
24000438	24000000	"If a black man can't move his store into a white community, you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community."	1242804137000
24000439	24000000	"The philosophy of black nationalism involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to economics."	1242804150500
24000440	24000000	"Our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you don't live, the community where you live will get poorer and poorer, and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer."	1242804159000
30000219	30000000	"As President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best path for that goal and then leading the nation along it."	1242804169000
30000220	30000000	"I pledge to you tonight that I shall meet this responsibility with all of the strength and wisdom I can command, in accordance with your hopes, mindful of your concerns, sustained by your prayers."	1242804179500
24000441	24000000	"Then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area."	1242804185000
24000442	24000000	"And where you and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up	 so that though we spend it in the community, at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere."	1242804192500
30000221	30000000	"Thank you and good night."	1242804196500
24000443	24000000	"He's got us in a vise."	1242804221500
24000444	24000000	"So the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church, in every civic organization, in every fraternal order, it's time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community."	1242804224500
24000445	24000000	"If we own the stores, if we operate the businesses, if we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we're developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind."	1242804244000
24000446	24000000	"Once you gain control of the economy of your own community, then you don't have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business."	1242804262000
24000447	24000000	"The social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils, the vices, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community."	1242804277000
24000448	24000000	"We our selves have to lift the level of our community, the standard of our community to a higher level, make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and won't be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where we're not wanted."	1242804294500
24000449	24000000	"So I say, in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism, it is not designed to make the black man re-evaluate the white man -- you know him already -- but to make the black man re-evaluate himself."	1242804322000
24000450	24000000	"Don't change the white man's mind -- you can't change his mind, and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of America -- America's conscience is bankrupt."	1242804341000
24000451	24000000	"She lost all conscience a long time ago."	1242804355500
24000452	24000000	"Uncle Sam has no conscience."	1242804359500
24000453	24000000	"They don't know what morals are."	1242804362000
24000454	24000000	"They don't try and eliminate an evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral	 they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence."	1242804365000
24000455	24000000	"So you're wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle Sam."	1242804378500
24000456	24000000	"If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him."	1242804387000
24000457	24000000	"So it is not necessary to change the white man's mind."	1242804396000
24000458	24000000	"We have to change our own mind."	1242804401500
24000459	24000000	"You can't change his mind about us."	1242804405000
24000460	24000000	"We've got to change our own minds about each other."	1242804408500
24000461	24000000	"We have to see each other with new eyes."	1242804413500
24000462	24000000	"We have to see each other as brothers and sisters."	1242804418000
24000463	24000000	"We have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony that's necessary to get this problem solved ourselves."	1242804423000
24000464	24000000	"How can we do this?"	1242804434000
24000465	24000000	"How can we avoid jealousy?"	1242804436500
24000466	24000000	"How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community?"	1242804439000
24000467	24000000	"I'll tell you how."	1242804446000
24000468	24000000	"I have watched how Billy Graham comes into a city, spreading what he calls the gospel of Christ, which is only white nationalism."	1242804448000
24000469	24000000	"That's what he is."	1242804459500
24000470	24000000	"Billy Graham is a white nationalist	 I'm a black nationalist."	1242804461500
24000471	24000000	"But since it's the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like Graham with suspicion and envy, how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders?"	1242804466500
24000472	24000000	"Don't think because they're church leaders that they don't have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous -- no, everybody's got it."	1242804488000
24000473	24000000	"It's not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal, as Pope I over there in Rome, they get in a closet so you can't hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on."	1242804499000
24000474	24000000	"Billy Graham comes in preaching the gospel of Christ."	1242804516500
24000475	24000000	"He evangelizes the gospel."	1242804521000
24000476	24000000	"He stirs everybody up, but he never tries to start a church."	1242804523000
24000477	24000000	"If he came in trying to start a church, all the churches would be against him."	1242804529000
24000478	24000000	"So, he just comes in talking about Christ and tells everybody who gets Christ to go to any church where Christ is	 and in this way the church cooperates with him."	1242804537000
24000479	24000000	"So we're going to take a page from his book."	1242804552500
24000480	24000000	"Our gospel is black nationalism."	1242804557500
24000481	24000000	"We're not trying to threaten the existence of any organization, but we're spreading the gospel of black nationalism."	1242804560000
24000482	24000000	"Anywhere there's a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join that church."	1242804569000
24000483	24000000	"If the NAACP is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join the NAACP."	1242804578000
24000484	24000000	"If CORE is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join CORE."	1242804585500
24000485	24000000	"Join any organization that has a gospel that's for the uplift of the black man."	1242804592000
24000486	24000000	"And when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising, pull out of it because that's not black nationalism."	1242804599500
24000487	24000000	"We'll find another one."	1242804610000
24000488	24000000	"And in this manner, the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality, and by August, it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political, economic and social philosophy of black nationalism."	1242804612000
24000489	24000000	"After these delegates convene, we will hold a seminar	 we will hold discussions	 we will listen to everyone."	1242804638500
24000490	24000000	"We want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers."	1242804647500
24000491	24000000	"And at that time, if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party, we'll form a black nationalist party."	1242804653500
24000492	24000000	"If it's necessary to form a black nationalist army, we'll form a black nationalist army."	1242804664000
24000493	24000000	"It'll be the ballot or the bullet."	1242804671500
24000494	24000000	"It'll be liberty or it'll be death."	1242804675000
24000495	24000000	"It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D."	1242804678500
24000496	24000000	"C."	1242804691500
24000497	24000000	"and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights."	1242804692000
24000498	24000000	"There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights."	1242804701000
24000499	24000000	"Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or Supreme Court decisions to give freedom to the black man."	1242804707000
24000500	24000000	"You let that white man know, if this is a country of freedom, let it be a country of freedom	 and if it's not a country of freedom, change it."	1242804727500
24000501	24000000	"We will work with anybody, anywhere, at any time, who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem head-on, nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent, but violent when the enemy gets violent."	1242804742500
24000502	24000000	"We'll work with you on the voter-registration drive, we'll work with you on rent strikes, we'll work with you on school boycotts	 I don't believe in any kind of integration	 I'm not even worried about it, because I know you're not going to get it anyway	 you're not going to get it because you're afraid to die	 you've got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man, because he'll get just as violent as those crackers in Mississippi, right here in Cleveland."	1242804759000
24000503	24000000	"But we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause we're against a segregated school system."	1242804803500
24000504	24000000	"A segregated school system produces children who, when they graduate, graduate with crippled minds."	1242804813000
24000505	24000000	"But this does not mean that a school is segregated because it's all black."	1242804820000
24000506	24000000	"A segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever."	1242804827000
24000507	24000000	"Let me explain what I mean."	1242804836500
24000508	24000000	"A segregated district or community is a community in which people live, but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community."	1242804839500
24000509	24000000	"They never refer to the white section as a segregated community."	1242804851000
24000510	24000000	"It's the all-Negro section that's a segregated community."	1242804856500
24000511	24000000	"Why?"	1242804860500
24000512	24000000	"The white man controls his own school, his own bank, his own economy, his own politics, his own everything, his own community	 but he also controls yours."	1242804861000
24000513	24000000	"When you're under someone else's control, you're segregated."	1242804874500
24000514	24000000	"They'll always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer, but it doesn't mean you're segregated just because you have your own."	1242804878500
24000515	24000000	"You've got to control your own."	1242804891500
24000516	24000000	"Just like the white man has control of his, you need to control yours."	1242804894500
24000517	24000000	"You know the best way to get rid of segregation?"	1242804901500
24000518	24000000	"The white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration."	1242804906500
24000519	24000000	"Segregation means that he puts you away from him, but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction	 separation means you're gone."	1242804913000
24000520	24000000	"And the white man will integrate faster than he'll let you separate."	1242804925500
24000521	24000000	"So we will work with you against the segregated school system because it's criminal, because it is absolutely destructive, in every way imaginable, to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education."	1242804931500
24000522	24000000	"Last but not least, I must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns."	1242804951500
24000523	24000000	"The only thing that I've ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes, it's time for Negroes to defend themselves."	1242804959500
24000524	24000000	"Article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun."	1242804978000
24000525	24000000	"It is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle."	1242804988000
24000526	24000000	"This doesn't mean you're going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks, although you'd be within your rights -- I mean, you'd be justified	 but that would be illegal and we don't do anything illegal."	1242804993500
24000527	24000000	"If the white man doesn't want the black man buying rifles and shotguns, then let the government do its job."	1242805014500
24000528	24000000	"That's all."	1242805024500
24000529	24000000	"And don't let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what Malcolm says -- why, you old Uncle Tom."	1242805025500
24000530	24000000	"He would never ask you if he thought you were going to say, \"Amen!\""	1242805038000
24000531	24000000	"No, he is making a Tom out of you."	1242805045000
24000532	24000000	"So, this doesn't mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people, but it is time, in 1964, if you are a man, to let that man know."	1242805049500
24000533	24000000	"If he's not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for, since he spends all those billions for his defense budget, he certainly can't begrudge you and me spending $12 or $15 for a single-shot, or double-action."	1242805064000
24000534	24000000	"I hope you understand."	1242805091000
24000535	24000000	"Don't go out shooting people, but any time -- brothers and sisters, and especially the men in this audience	 some of you wearing Congressional Medals of Honor, with shoulders this wide, chests this big, muscles that big -- any time you and I sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood, not some grownups, but four little girls while they were praying to the same God the white man taught them to pray to, and you and I see the government go down and can't find who did it."	1242805093000
24000536	24000000	"Why, this man -- he can find Eichmann hiding down in Argentina somewhere."	1242805140500
24000537	24000000	"Let two or three American soldiers, who are minding somebody else's business way over in South Vietnam, get killed, and he'll send battleships, sticking his nose in their business."	1242805147000
24000538	24000000	"He wanted to send troops down to Cuba and make them have what he calls free elections -- this old cracker who doesn't have free elections in his own country."	1242805161500
24000539	24000000	"No, if you never see me another time in your life, if I die in the morning, I'll die saying one thing: the ballot or the bullet, the ballot or the bullet."	1242805176500
24000540	24000000	"If a Negro in 1964 has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people, why, you and I should hang our heads in shame."	1242805192500
24000541	24000000	"You talk about a march on Washington in 1963, you haven't seen anything."	1242805210500
24000542	24000000	"There's some more going down in '64."	1242805217000
24000543	24000000	"And this time they're not going like they went last year."	1242805220500
24000544	24000000	"They're not going singing \"We Shall Overcome.\""	1242805226000
24000545	24000000	"They're not going with white friends."	1242805229500
24000546	24000000	"They're not going with placards already painted for them."	1242805232500
24000547	24000000	"They're not going with round-trip tickets."	1242805237000
24000548	24000000	"They're going with one way tickets."	1242805240000
24000549	24000000	"And if they don't want that non-nonviolent army going down there, tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt."	1242805243000
24000550	24000000	"The black nationalists aren't going to wait."	1242805253000
24000551	24000000	"Lyndon B."	1242805256500
24000552	24000000	"Johnson is the head of the Democratic Party."	1242805257500
24000553	24000000	"If he's for civil rights, let him go into the Senate next week and declare himself."	1242805261500
24000554	24000000	"Let him go in there right now and declare himself."	1242805269500

24000556	24000000	"Let him go in there right now and take a moral stand -- right now, not later."	1242805281000
24000557	24000000	"Tell him, don't wait until election time."	1242805289500
24000558	24000000	"If he waits too long, brothers and sisters, he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of."	1242805293000
24000559	24000000	"In 1964, it's the ballot or the bullet."	1242805317500
